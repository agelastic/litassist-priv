# Test Status

## Current State

All broken tests have been removed. Only working tests remain.

## Working Tests âœ…
- `test_basic.py` - Basic infrastructure tests
- `test_real_functionality.py` - Real function tests with proper examples

## Deleted Tests (Were Broken)
- All command tests (brainstorm, extractfacts, strategy, etc.)
- Module tests (llm, retriever, utils)
- Integration tests
- E2E tests

## Next Steps

1. Add new tests based on `test_real_functionality.py` template
2. Test one function/feature at a time
3. Ensure tests work locally before committing
4. Keep tests simple and focused

## Test Template

See `test_real_functionality.py` for examples of:
- Proper file handling with `isolated_filesystem()`
- Correct mocking patterns
- Real functionality testing
