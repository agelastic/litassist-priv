# LitAssist Development TODO

## Current State Summary

### Completed Features ‚úÖ
- All 9 core commands (lookup, digest, extractfacts, brainstorm, strategy, draft, verify, counselnotes, barbrief)
- Global installation via pipx
- Single configuration approach
- Outputs organized in `outputs/` directory
- Comprehensive documentation suite
- Australian legal focus throughout
- Timestamped outputs preventing data loss
- Multi-level verification system
- Zero-tolerance citation enforcement
- Clean CLI summaries instead of content dumps
- Comprehensive logging and timing instrumentation
- Fixed all ruff linting errors and removed unused dependencies
- Memory Bank initialized with core context, patterns, architecture, and technical setup
- CounselNotes command for strategic advocate analysis (January 2025)
- Barbrief command for comprehensive barrister's briefs (January 2025)

### Pending Tasks ‚åõ
- [ ] REMOVE temporary glob help addon after unification (delete glob_help_addon.yaml, remove concatenation logic)
- [ ] IMPLEMENT full glob unification per claude_glob_unification_plan.md (centralize expand_glob_patterns, update 5+ commands)
- Implement advanced LLM prompting improvements from LLM_IMPROVEMENTS.md (IRAC/MIRAT, multi-model consensus, confidence scoring, adversarial testing)
- Develop manual validation scripts for OpenRouter and extended RAG workflows (in test-scripts/)
- Add cost-tracking system and quality-tier command options
- Create compound workflow commands (e.g., `workflow initial-advice`)
- Enhance QA loops: iterative improvement, contingency planning, multi-perspective reviews
- Update user/developer documentation to reflect new features when implemented
- Automate performance benchmarking and monitoring setup
- Implement OpenAI API fine-tuning per platform recommendations
- Add LLM response streaming functionality
- Expose model configuration parameters via CLI/env vars
- Develop "student mode" with newcomer-friendly explanations
- Add thinking trace logging system
- Integrate o3-pro coding standards
- Adopt Jules framework for test instrumentation
- **Refactor verify_with_level (Option B)**: Replace with boolean parameter `verify(content, comprehensive=False)` where comprehensive=True uses heavy verification prompt and comprehensive=False uses standard verification. This simplifies the API and removes the unused "light" level and redundant "medium" wrapper. See plan details from 2025-07-07.
- **Add optional reasoning trace file output**: Implement `--save-reasoning` flag for commands (strategy, draft, verify, etc.) to optionally save legal reasoning traces as separate files for auditing purposes. Currently reasoning traces are embedded in main output only. Implementation removed 2025-07-08 but may be useful for professional liability requirements.
- **Implement circuit breaker for API retries**: Add safety_cutoff parameter to disable retries after N failures/hour (see AG-124)

### Next Steps üöÄ
1. Commit `memory-bank/` directory and its files
2. Merge initial Memory Bank into main branch
3. Schedule sprint to implement high-impact prompt and verification enhancements
4. Enhance manual API validation scripts per updated testing approach
5. Plan cost-tracking and workflow command prototypes
6. Review and prioritize new TODO items for implementation

## Future Plans üìÖ
- See detailed LLM improvements in `docs/development/LLM_IMPROVEMENTS.md`  
- Integration test strategy in `docs/development/integration_testing_approach.md`  
- Cost-tracking and quality-tier features (planning in progress)  
- Compound workflow commands prototypes (e.g., `workflow initial-advice`)  
- Advanced QA loops: adversarial testing, iterative improvement loops, contingency planning  
- Performance benchmarking and monitoring setup  

## Implementation Concerns & Considerations üö®

### Key Architectural Implementation Points üèóÔ∏è
1. **OpenAI Fine-tuning Integration**: Review `litassist/llm.py` integration points, extend LLMClient factory pattern to support fine-tuned model endpoints
2. **Streaming Implementation**: Update CLI output handlers in `litassist/cli.py`, modify response processing in command modules (`litassist/commands/`), add progress indicators
3. **Student Mode**: Leverage existing prompt templates in `litassist/prompts/`, extend base.yaml and system_feedback.yaml with beginner-friendly variants
4. **Model Configuration**: Extend `litassist/config.py` with new environment variable mappings, update `config.yaml.template` with streaming/model options
5. **Thinking Traces**: Add new logging handlers in `litassist/utils.py`, extend output directory structure for trace files
6. **o3-pro Standards**: Review existing code patterns in `litassist/commands/` modules, update linting rules in `setup.py` and `requirements-ci.txt`
7. **Jules Framework**: Integrate with existing test infrastructure in `tests/unit/`, update `test-scripts/` directory structure
8. **Config Exposure**: Add CLI arguments in `litassist/cli.py`, extend configuration validation in `litassist/config.py`

### Technical Architecture Concerns
- **Jules Framework Integration**: Need to research Jules framework documentation and compatibility with existing test infrastructure
- **o3-pro Standards**: Requires clarification on specific coding standards and how they integrate with current Python/legal domain patterns
- **Model Config Exposure**: Risk of breaking existing config.yaml structure; need backward compatibility strategy
- **Fine-tuning Implementation**: Requires OpenAI API credits, training data preparation, and evaluation metrics - significant cost implications
- **Streaming Architecture**: Major refactor needed for CLI output handling, progress indicators, and error handling during streaming
- **Student Mode Design**: Risk of prompt bloat; need clear separation between expert and beginner explanations
- **Thinking Traces**: Potential performance impact on response times; need configurable verbosity levels

### Integration Risks  
- New features may conflict with existing zero-tolerance citation enforcement
- Streaming could interfere with current output timestamping and file organization
- Model config changes might break OpenRouter integration
- Student mode explanations could dilute legal accuracy requirements

### Resource & Timeline Concerns
- Fine-tuning requires significant API budget and data preparation time
- Jules framework adoption may require team training
- Multiple concurrent LLM architecture changes increase testing complexity
- Student mode requires extensive legal domain expertise for accurate simplification

## Notes
- Prioritize minimal whitespace changes to maintain clean diffs
- Reference Memory Bank for all session context and planning
- Consider implementing features incrementally with feature flags to minimize integration risk
- Establish clear success criteria and rollback plans for each major change
