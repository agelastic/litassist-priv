# Lookup Command Fix Summary

## Problem
The lookup command was failing with citation verification errors, incorrectly flagging valid Australian tribunal citations (like [2011] VCAT 203) as invalid and potential AI hallucinations.

## Root Causes
1. The lookup command was using strict citation verification by default
2. Not using the LLMClientFactory pattern like other commands
3. The LLMClient was ignoring the `force_verify: False` configuration
4. Incorrect model name for Gemini

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Switched to LLMClientFactory
Updated `lookup.py` to use:
```python
client = LLMClientFactory.for_command("lookup", **overrides)
```

### 2. Added Lookup Configuration
Added to `llm.py` COMMAND_CONFIGS:
```python
"lookup": {
    "model": "google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "top_p": 0.2,
    "force_verify": False,  # Don't force strict verification
},
```

### 3. Fixed Citation Verification Logic
Modified `LLMClient.complete()` to respect the force_verify setting:
```python
# Citation verification - respect force_verify setting
strict_mode = getattr(self, "_force_verify", True)  # Default to strict unless explicitly disabled
```

### 4. Fixed Force Verify Flag Setting
Changed in `LLMClientFactory.for_command()`:
```python
# Set force verification flag - explicitly set both True and False
client._force_verify = force_verify
```

## Test Results
All extraction modes now work correctly:
- ✅ Citations extraction
- ✅ Principles extraction  
- ✅ Checklist extraction
- ✅ Both Google and Jade search engines
- ✅ Valid tribunal citations no longer blocked
- ✅ Default output formatting preserved (no broken markdown)

## Additional Fixes: Output Formatting

### Root Cause: Gemini-Specific Issue
The lookup command is the ONLY command using `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview`, while most other commands use Claude or other models. Gemini has specific formatting characteristics:
- Returns content with minimal line breaks
- Headers and paragraphs often run together
- Different output structure compared to Claude/GPT models

### Solution Evolution:
1. **Initial Attempt**: Added aggressive regex patterns that broke after every sentence
   - This created too many line breaks and disrupted natural paragraph flow
   
2. **Second Attempt**: Removed all formatting
   - This preserved Gemini's output but left headers and paragraphs running together
   
3. **Final Solution**: Minimal Gemini-specific formatting
   - Only adds spacing around headers (without breaking header text)
   - Ensures horizontal rules are properly spaced
   - Fixes numbered lists that run together
   - Cleans up excessive newlines
   - Preserves natural paragraph flow

### Key Insight:
This is a model-specific issue unique to Gemini. Other commands using Claude/GPT don't need special formatting because those models already provide well-structured output with proper line breaks.

## Use Cases Verified
The following use cases from LOOKUP_USE_CASES.md now work:
1. Criminal law: bail applications, self-defence checklists
2. Family law: relocation factors, property settlement
3. Commercial law: director duties checklist
4. Civil litigation: negligence elements with legislation references

The lookup command now provides rapid, practical legal research without being blocked by overly strict citation verification or formatting issues.
