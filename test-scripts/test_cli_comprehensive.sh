Procedural History:
- 1 April 2024: Statement of Claim filed in District Court
- 15 April 2024: Defence filed with cross-claim
- 1 May 2024: Case management conference held
- 15 June 2024: Discovery orders made

LEGAL STRATEGIES - Johnson v State Rail Authority

PRIMARY STRATEGY: Negligence and Breach of Statutory Duty
- Establish State Rail's knowledge of signal fault (20 Dec 2023)
- Demonstrate three-week delay was unreasonable
- Link maintenance failure directly to incident
- Invoke Rail Safety National Law obligations
- Reference WorkCover v State Rail precedent

ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY: Strict Liability Approach
- Argue non-delegable duty of care for passenger safety
- Focus on res ipsa loquitur doctrine
- Emergency stops should not cause injury if proper
- Shift burden of proof to defendant

DAMAGES STRATEGY:
- Lead with special damages (quantifiable losses)
- Medical expenses: $25,000 (documented)
- Lost wages: 6 months at $85,000 p.a = $42,500
- Future earning capacity: actuarial assessment
- General damages within Civil Liability Act caps
- Aggravated damages for systemic failure

AFFIDAVIT OF SARAH JOHNSON

I, SARAH JOHNSON, of 42 Maple Street, Parramatta NSW 2150, Teacher, 
MAKE OATH AND SAY:

1. I am the Plaintiff in these proceedings and make this affidavit from

4. I was standing near the doors, holding my bag, preparing to alight at 
   the next station. The force of the stop threw me forward violently.

5. My head struck a vertical pole with significant force. I immediately 
   felt severe pain and dizziness.

6. Annexed and marked "SJ-1" is a copy of the medical report from Royal 
   Prince Alfred Hospital dated 16 January 2024.
