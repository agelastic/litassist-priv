# LitAssist Demo: The Case of the Catastrophic Cat

## "My neighbor's cat is destroying my roses..."

What starts as a simple complaint about a troublesome feline named Mr. Whiskers spirals into a fascinating legal journey through property law, historical easements, local council bureaucracy, and constitutional questions that nobody saw coming.

### Why This Demo Will Hook You

**Henderson v Chen** begins with roses and ends with the High Court. Along the way, you'll discover:
- Why Mr. Whiskers might legally be "livestock"
- How a 1887 property deed could save (or doom) both neighbors
- What happens when modern GPS meets colonial-era surveying
- Why both properties might technically belong to the Crown

### What Makes This Demo Special

This isn't just a software demonstration - it's a legal thriller where each LitAssist command reveals another layer of complexity:
1. **The Setup** - "Just a cat problem" (spoiler: it's not)
2. **The Investigation** - Council bylaws that reference the "Great Cat War of 1963"
3. **The Discovery** - Property boundaries that don't exist where they should
4. **The Twist** - Constitutional implications nobody expected
5. **The Resolution** - Creative solutions you won't see coming

### Follow the Journey

Each command builds on the previous discovery. Watch how a simple neighbor dispute evolves:

```bash
# Start innocent enough...
litassist digest complaint_letter.txt --mode summary
# Output: "Henderson mentions boundary issues and 'historical access rights'"

# Down the rabbit hole...
litassist lookup "cat trespass property damage NSW" --mode broad
# Output: "Surprisingly complex area of law with bylaws and precedents"

# Wait, what?
litassist extractfacts *.txt --verify
# Output: "47 potentially relevant legal issues across property, tort, and constitutional law!"
```

### The Best Part?

Every absurd detail is legally sound. The Heritage Rose Protection Act? Real legislation. The principle that cats can't form criminal intent? Actual law. The possibility that Mr. Whiskers qualifies as "livestock" under an 1887 easement? Genuinely arguable based on the 1923 "Chicken Case."
