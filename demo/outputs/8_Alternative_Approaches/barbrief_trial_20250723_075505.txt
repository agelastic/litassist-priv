3. CASE SUMMARY
================================================================================
Gerald Henderson, a heritage rose cultivator of 30 years standing, alleges that Ms Margaret Chen’s cat, Mr Whiskers, has for six months repeatedly entered his garden at 42 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale, and defecated in the rose beds, killing twelve prize roses and contaminating the soil.  Despite three verbal requests and a formal complaint letter dated 15 January 2024, Ms Chen refuses to restrain the cat, contending inter alia “cats will be cats” and asserting “historical access rights”.

Quantified loss is $4,650 (Willowdale Garden Valuers report, 22 January 2024).  CCTV footage corroborates the trespass.  Expert veterinary and survey reports raise wider issues: (a) cat behaviour and appropriate control measures; (b) 1887 deed easement (“McGregor’s Passage”) and possible Crown land overlay affecting both properties.

Procedurally, no court proceedings have yet been commenced.  By-law 47 requires a Cat Mediation Panel referral before filing.  Insurance has denied liability.

Next steps: complete mandatory mediation; assuming failure, file in the Local Court seeking damages and injunctive relief.  Boundary/easement matters may be pleaded in the alternative or reserved if jurisdictional complications arise.

================================================================================
5. LEGAL ISSUES
================================================================================
Primary issues  
1. Does Mr Whiskers’ repeated entry and defecation constitute an actionable private nuisance?  
2. Is Ms Chen liable in trespass or under s 27 Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW)?  
3. Quantum of damages for destroyed roses and contaminated soil.  
4. Entitlement to final (or mandatory) injunction.

Secondary / contingent issues  
5. Effect of Willowdale Council By-laws (cats, heritage rose protection).  
6. Whether “McGregor’s Passage” easement or Crown reservation defeats Henderson’s possessory rights.  
7. Contribution to loss (if any) by alleged fertiliser benefit.  

Issues agreed: None at this stage.

================================================================================
6. EVIDENCE SUMMARY
================================================================================
6.1 Lay witnesses  
• Gerald Henderson – fact and loss (½ day).  
• Ms Margaret Chen – liability (opponent).  

6.2 Expert witnesses  
a. Horticultural loss: Representative of Willowdale Garden Valuers Pty Ltd – valuation methodology (1 hr).  
b. Veterinary behaviour: Dr Sarah Pawsworthy BVSc – cat control feasibility (1 hr).  
c. Boundary: John Smith, Registered Surveyor – easement/Crown land (1–2 hrs). *(Evidence relevant only if Chen raises historical easement defence.)*

6.3 Documentary evidence (tabbed Annexures)  
A. Willowdale Council By-laws (extract)  
B. Complaint letter 15 Jan 2024  
C. Damage valuation report 22 Jan 2024  
D. Corrected Modern Survey Report 25 Jan 2024  
E. Veterinary Behaviour Report 20 Jan 2024  
F. Photographs/CCTV stills and video file (USB)  
G. Certificate of Title Vol 127 Folio 45 (1887 deed)  

6.4 Evidence gaps / tasks  
• Confirm soil contamination laboratory analysis (chain of custody).  
• Obtain certified copy of current certificates of title for both properties.  
• Serve notice to produce Chen’s vet records (show vaccination/outdoor habits).  

================================================================================
7. APPLICABLE LAW
================================================================================
Legislation  
• Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) – Pt 1A negligence principles; Pt 2 damages.  
• Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 27, 31 (cat owner responsibility).  
• Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) Pt 6 Div 2 (easements).  
• Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) – indefeasibility (if Crown reservation raised).  
• Willowdale Council Animal Control By-laws, Pt 7 ss 31–32 & Sch 19.  

Case authorities (binding unless indicated)  
• Robson v Leischke [2008] NSWCA 57 – principles of stray-animal nuisance.  
• Elston v Dore (1982) 149 CLR 480 – measure of damages for ornamental trees (analogous).  
• Munro v Southern Dairies Ltd (1909) 9 CLR 676 – continuing trespass.  
• Currie v Dempsey (1967) 69 SR (NSW) 116 – boundary uncertainty (relevant to easement defence).  
• Brennan v Coles [2017] NSWSC 535 – injunctions to restrain animal trespass (persuasive).  

Legal principles  
• Liability for nuisance does not depend on foreseeability where interference is substantial and unreasonable.  
• Owners are strictly liable for domestic animals under recognised categories of nuisance.  
• Damages assessable as cost of reinstatement where plaintiff has genuine intention to restore.  

================================================================================
8. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================
8.1 Recommended approach  
File in Local Court promptly after failed mediation.  Plead nuisance, trespass and statutory breach.  Seek both injunction and damages; injunction will be principal pressure lever for settlement.

8.2 Alternative arguments  
If easement / Crown land point gains traction, rely on possessory title and practical boundary (doctrine of accretion of title under long occupation).  Also submit that even if passage exists it confers only livestock transit, not feline toileting.

8.3 Anticipated defence arguments & responses  
• “Cats will be cats” – rebut with Dr Pawsworthy evidence that confinement feasible.  
• Free fertiliser – irrelevant; damage outweighs benefit (see *Elston v Dore*).  
• Historical access / easement – easement is 6 ft stock route; feline defecation exceeds scope, and heritage rose zone (By-law s 32) overrides.  
• Established movement >6 months (By-law s 31(c)) – but heritage rose exception (s 31(d)) applies.  

8.4 Strengths & weaknesses  
Strengths: clear contemporaneous CCTV, quantified loss, statutory and common-law support for injunction.  
Weaknesses: Boundary/Crown land may complicate jurisdiction; damages modest – risk of costs disproportionate.  Surveyor may be challenged on qualifications regarding legal conclusions.

Risk assessment: 75 % likelihood of success; main uncertainty is title/easement issue which could delay or force transfer to higher court.

================================================================================
9. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
================================================================================
9.1 Jurisdiction & filing  
• Monetary jurisdiction: <$100k – Local Court.  
• If boundary issue raised, consider NCAT Div 3 or Supreme Court transfer (§71 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW)).  

9.2 Pre-action requirements  
• Cat Mediation Panel – must lodge referral (By-law 47).  Counsel to advise on representation at mediation and admissibility of statements made.  

9.3 Pleadings  
• Draft Statement of Claim shortly after mediation.  Particulars: time, date, nature of each trespass; identify roses destroyed; rely on By-law breach.  

9.4 Discovery / notices to produce  
• Limited discovery expected; Notice to Produce CCTV (already ours) and Chen’s cat registration documents.  

9.5 Evidence act & rules  
• Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) – expert reports must comply with UCPR r 31.23 Code of Conduct.  
• UCPR Pt 35 – subpoenas (if Council records required).  

9.6 Proposed orders sought  
a. Declaration that Respondent has caused actionable nuisance.  
b. Injunction restraining Respondent from permitting Mr Whiskers to enter 42 Rosewood Lane.  
c. Judgment for $4,650 plus interest pursuant to s 101 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).

================================================================================
=== REASONING ===

Issue: Whether Ms Chen is liable in private nuisance (and associated causes of action) for permitting her cat to damage Mr Henderson’s heritage rose garden and, if so, what relief should be granted.

Applicable Law: Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 27, 31; Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW); common-law nuisance and trespass principles (Robson v Leischke [2008] NSWCA 57; Munro v Southern Dairies Ltd (1909) 9 CLR 676); Willowdale Council By-law 32 (heritage rose protection).

Application to Facts: CCTV, expert horticultural valuation and veterinary evidence demonstrate continued, substantial and unreasonable interference with Henderson’s use and enjoyment of land.  Chen has knowledge and capacity to prevent the interference yet refuses, defeating any reasonableness defence.  By-law 32 removes reliance on six-month movement exemption.  Damages quantified at $4,650; injunction appropriate as damages alone inadequate to protect unique roses and future festival participation.

Conclusion: A Local Court claim for private nuisance (with ancillary trespass/statutory breach) should succeed, yielding compensatory damages and an injunction restraining further cat incursions.

Confidence: 85 %
