### Executive Summary

In New South Wales, the legal framework governing liability for damage caused by domestic animals draws a sharp distinction between dogs and cats. While the owner of a dog is held strictly liable for any property damage or personal injury it causes, no such statutory liability exists for the owner of a cat. The primary legislative instrument, the *Companion Animals Act 1998* (NSW), provides a specific cause of action for damage caused by dogs but is silent on a similar remedy for cats. This means a person whose property has been damaged by a trespassing cat cannot rely on a simple statutory claim for compensation.

Consequently, a person seeking compensation for damage caused by a cat must turn to the common law torts of negligence or private nuisance. However, such claims face significant legal hurdles. Establishing that a cat owner breached a duty of care by allowing their pet to roam, a widely accepted practice, is difficult. Similarly, a claim in nuisance generally requires proving a substantial and unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of land, which a single or minor act of damage by a cat is unlikely to satisfy. The most practical, though non-compensatory, remedy available is to make a complaint to the local council, which has the power to issue a "nuisance cat order" to compel the owner to control their animal's behaviour.


### Analysis

The principal legislation governing domestic pets in New South Wales is the *Companion Animals Act 1998* (NSW) ("the Act"). This Act creates a clear and distinct legal regime for liability depending on whether the animal in question is a dog or a cat. For dogs, the Act establishes a form of strict liability. Section 25(1) of the Act states that the owner of a dog is liable for damages in respect of bodily injury to a person or damage to the property of a person caused by the dog. This statutory liability, which removes the old common law need to prove the owner knew of the dog's mischievous propensity, continues a principle from the now-repealed *Dog Act 1966* (NSW). The strict nature of this liability for dog owners is confirmed in cases such as *Hill v Higgins* [2012] NSWSC 270, where the owner was found liable under section 25 for injuries caused by their dog.

In stark contrast, the *Companion Animals Act 1998* (NSW) contains no equivalent provision imposing strict liability on cat owners for damage their animals may cause. The legislative focus for cats is on identification and control rather than automatic liability for damages. The Act provides a mechanism to deal with problematic cats through section 32, which allows a local council to declare a cat a "nuisance cat". A cat can be declared a nuisance if it, among other things, "repeatedly damages anything outside the property on which it is ordinarily kept". An authorised officer can then issue a nuisance cat order to the owner, and failure to comply is an offence. This process, however, is a regulatory measure aimed at preventing future harm; it does not create a direct right for the affected property owner to sue the cat's owner for compensation for damage already done.

Given the absence of a statutory remedy for damages, a person whose property is damaged by a trespassing cat must rely on common law causes of action, primarily negligence or private nuisance. To succeed in negligence, the plaintiff must establish that the cat's owner owed them a duty of care, that the owner breached this duty, and that this breach caused the damage. While a duty of care to prevent one's pet from damaging a neighbour's property is likely to exist, proving a breach is challenging. Courts would have to consider whether allowing a domestic cat to roam freely constitutes a failure to take reasonable care. Given that this is a common and widely accepted practice in Australia, it would be difficult to argue that this behaviour, without more, falls below the required standard of care.

Alternatively, a claim could be framed in the tort of private nuisance, which involves an unreasonable interference with a person's use and enjoyment of their land. The key legal test is one of reasonableness. As demonstrated in the Western Australian case of *Marsh v Baxter* [2015] WASCA 169, where the escape of GM canola onto an organic farm was found not to constitute a nuisance, the threshold for what is considered an "unreasonable" interference is high. A single incident of a cat trespassing and causing minor damage, such as scratching a door or digging in a garden bed, is unlikely to be viewed by a court as a sufficiently substantial or unreasonable interference to ground a claim in nuisance. The wording in section 32 of the *Companion Animals Act 1998* (NSW), which refers to a cat that "*repeatedly* damages" property, lends support to the view that isolated incidents are not considered legally actionable at a high level. Therefore, a successful nuisance claim would likely require evidence of persistent and significant damage over time.


### Conclusion

Under New South Wales law, an owner of a cat is not strictly liable for property damage caused by their animal when it trespasses. Unlike the clear statutory liability imposed on dog owners by section 25 of the *Companion Animals Act 1998* (NSW), there is no parallel provision for cats. This legislative gap means that a person seeking financial compensation for such damage faces a significant uphill battle.

The only direct statutory recourse is to report the animal to the local council, which may issue a nuisance order under section 32 of the Act to prevent future damage, but this does not provide compensation. A civil claim at common law, either in negligence or private nuisance, is theoretically possible but has a low prospect of success due to the difficulty in proving that the owner breached a duty of care or that the cat's behaviour constituted an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's land. In summary, while a cat owner has a responsibility to control their pet, the legal avenues for a neighbour to obtain compensation for property damage are extremely limited and difficult to pursue.
