Draft Mediation Proposal  
Shared Use of Garden Area – Heritage Roses & Potential Historical Cat Easement  
Willowdale Council Cat Mediation Panel Matter No: [TO BE PROVIDED]

1. Parties  
1.1 Gerald Henderson of 42 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale NSW 2234 (Complainant).  
1.2 Ms Margaret Chen of 44 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale NSW 2234 (Respondent).  
1.3 Mr Whiskers Chen (7-year-old domestic shorthair cat).  
1.4 Willowdale Council Cat Mediation Panel (statutory facilitator pursuant to Willowdale Council Bylaws – Animal Control) (the Panel).  

2. Background  
2.1 Mr Henderson maintains a heritage rose garden cultivated over 30 years and awarded Best in Show at the 2023 Willowdale Garden Festival.  
2.2 Since or about August 2023, Mr Whiskers has regularly entered Mr Henderson’s garden and defecated in the rose beds, causing contamination and physical damage.  
2.3 A professional assessment dated 22 January 2024 places quantifiable damages at $4,650.  
2.4 Ms Chen contends that Mr Whiskers enjoys “historical access rights” by virtue of an alleged easement known as “McGregor’s Passage” referenced in an 1887 deed (Certificate of Title Volume 127 Folio 45).  
2.5 No court proceedings have been commenced. The Willowdale Council Bylaws require referral to this mediation as a pre-litigation step.  

3. Purpose of Proposal  
3.1 To reach a binding, practical and cost-effective resolution that:  
      (a) stops further damage to the heritage rose garden;  
      (b) respects any lawful easement rights pending formal determination;  
      (c) compensates past loss; and  
      (d) avoids litigation in the Local Court of NSW or NCAT.  

4. Governing Legal Framework (summary only)  
4.1 Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) – owner responsibility for cats.  
4.2 Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) – duty of care and recoverable damages.  
4.3 Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) – creation and scope of easements.  
4.4 Common law nuisance and trespass.  
4.5 Willowdale Council Bylaws – Animal Control (mandatory mediation; heritage rose protection provisions).  

5. Proposed Terms of Settlement  

Term 1 – Acknowledgment  
5.1 The parties acknowledge Mr Henderson’s proprietary interest in his heritage roses and Ms Chen’s legitimate interest in the welfare and reasonable movement of Mr Whiskers.

5.3 Ms Chen will:  
     (a) encourage Mr Whiskers to use the Corridor by installing attractant planting or paving approved by both parties; and  
     (b) install, at her cost, discrete fencing or barrier devices approved by the Panel to discourage cat entry into rose beds.  
5.4 Mr Henderson will refrain from placing physical obstructions within the Corridor save for mutually agreed low-impact deterrents (e.g., ultrasonic device already in situ).  

Term 3 – Containment Times  
5.5 Between [START TIME TO BE CONFIRMED] and [END TIME TO BE CONFIRMED] each day, Mr Whiskers will be confined to Ms Chen’s premises or secure cat enclosure, unless accompanied by Ms Chen on a harness or within the Corridor.

Term 5 – Future Damage Protocol  
5.7 If further verified cat-related damage occurs, the parties will first notify each other in writing within 48 hours and obtain a joint assessment by Willowdale Garden Valuers Pty Ltd.

Term 6 – Boundary & Easement Clarification  
5.9 The parties will jointly instruct Modern Survey Consultants Pty Ltd to:  
     (a) prepare a plan showing the precise location of “McGregor’s Passage”; and  
     (b) advise on the easement’s current validity and extent.  
5.10 Survey costs will be shared equally, unless the plan shows the easement does not encumber Mr Henderson’s land, in which case Ms Chen will bear 100 % of the cost.  

Term 7 – Garden Festival Participation  
5.11 The parties will cooperate to ensure Mr Henderson’s participation in the 2024 Willowdale Garden Festival is not impeded by cat activity.

=== REASONING ===  

Issue: Whether a mediated settlement can reconcile Mr Henderson’s interest in protecting his heritage roses with Ms Chen’s asserted historical easement for her cat, thereby preventing future damage and avoiding litigation.  

Applicable Law: Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW); Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW); Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) (easements); common law nuisance and trespass; Willowdale Council Bylaws – Animal Control.  

Application to Facts: The cat’s repeated entry and resulting damage give rise to potential nuisance/trespass liability under common law and statutory duties under the Companion Animals Act. Quantified losses ($4,650) are recoverable as special damages. However, Ms Chen’s reference to an 1887 easement raises a conceivable defence under the Conveyancing Act, justifying an interim access corridor while the easement’s existence is clarified. The proposal therefore combines compensation for proven past damage, behavioural and physical measures to prevent recurrence, and a jointly-funded survey to resolve the easement question, consistent with local by-law mandates for mediated outcomes.  

Conclusion: The draft terms fairly allocate risk, compensate past loss, preserve potential easement rights, and align with NSW statutory and common-law principles, satisfying the parties’ objectives and the Council’s mediation requirements.  

Confidence: 83 %
