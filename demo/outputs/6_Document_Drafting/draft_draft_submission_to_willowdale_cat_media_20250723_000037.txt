IN THE MATTER OF THE WILLOWDALE COUNCIL CAT MEDIATION PANEL  
BETWEEN  
Gerald Henderson (Complainant)  
and  
Margaret Chen (Respondent) – owner of “Mr Whiskers”

DRAFT SUBMISSIONS FOR THE RESPONDENT  
[Prepared for the 2024 Willowdale Council Cat Mediation Panel hearing – date to be confirmed]

IMPORTANT: All square-bracketed text contains information required from the client or to be confirmed from existing evidence. No new facts have been assumed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.   These submissions are filed on behalf of Ms Margaret Chen (“the Respondent”) pursuant to clause [BYLAW REF TO BE PROVIDED] of the Willowdale Council Animal Control Bylaws, which mandates referral of neighbourhood cat disputes to the Cat Mediation Panel (“the Panel”) prior to litigation.  
2.   The Respondent seeks a negotiated resolution that:  
     (a) protects Mr Henderson’s heritage rose garden;  
     (b) safeguards the welfare of Mr Whiskers; and  
     (c) preserves neighbourly relations in Rosewood Lane.  
3.   Central to this proposal is evidence that Mr Whiskers displays unusual feline intelligence and demonstrable aesthetic engagement with his surroundings. Those traits make structured behavioural modification both feasible and ethically appropriate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
B.   JURISDICTION
4.   Jurisdiction is conferred by Part [PART NUMBER TO BE PROVIDED] of the Willowdale Council Animal Control Bylaws.  
5.   The subject matter—alleged property damage under $10,000 and ongoing companion-animal behaviour—falls squarely within the Panel’s remit. The parties are residents of Willowdale, New South Wales.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
C.   AGREED AND NON-CONTENTIOUS FACTS
6.   The parties accept the following:  
     (a) Mr Whiskers is a 7-year-old domestic shorthair cat owned by the Respondent (para 1, Supporting Document).  
     (b) Between August 2023 and January 2024 Mr Whiskers entered the Complainant’s rose garden on multiple occasions (para 3).  
     (c) The Complainant values his roses highly and claims $4,650 in damage (paras 1 & 5).  
     (d) A veterinary behavioural assessment was completed on 20 January 2024 by Dr Sarah Pawsworthy, BVSc (para 5).  
     (e) A professional valuation and a modern survey report were completed on 22 and 25 January 2024 respectively (para 3).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
D.   DISPUTED ISSUES
7.   The parties disagree on:  
     (a) Whether the conduct constitutes an actionable nuisance under NSW common law;  
     (b) Whether any historical easement (“McGregor’s Passage”, 1887 deed) legitimises feline passage;  
     (c) Quantum of recoverable loss; and  
     (d) The appropriate remedial or preventative measures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
E.   BEHAVIOURAL AND INTELLECTUAL TRAITS OF MR WHISKERS
8.   Dr Pawsworthy’s assessment (20 January 2024) records the following observations:  
     (a) [DIRECT QUOTE FROM REPORT AT P. __ – TO BE PROVIDED];  
     (b) Mr Whiskers demonstrated problem-solving abilities during cognitive testing, including [SPECIFIC TASK – TO BE PROVIDED];  
     (c) The cat displayed prolonged investigative sniffing of rose specimens without immediate elimination behaviour in controlled conditions.  
9.   CCTV footage supplied by the Complainant shows Mr Whiskers making sustained eye contact with the security camera before departing the garden on [DATE TO BE CONFIRMED]. This behaviour is consistent with heightened environmental awareness.  
10.  Expert commentary (Dr Pawsworthy, section [SECTION NUMBER TO BE PROVIDED]) links such advanced cognition to the efficacy of positive-reinforcement training programs, including litter-tray re-direction and boundary conditioning.  
11.  The Respondent therefore submits that Mr Whiskers’ intelligence and apparent sensory interest in horticultural elements make non-invasive containment strategies both realistic and humane.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
F.   LEGAL FRAMEWORK
12.  Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW)  
     (a) s 30 imposes a general responsibility on cat owners to prevent nuisance behaviour.  
     (b) s 32 encourages “reasonable measures” rather than automatic confinement orders.  
13.  Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) – general duty of care principles (ss 5B-5C).  
14.  Willowdale Council Animal Control Bylaws – cl [NUMBER TO BE PROVIDED] provides for mediation first; cl [NUMBER] recognises “behavioural management plans” as compliant mitigation.  
15.  Common-law nuisance authorities: Robson v Hallett [1967] 2 QB 939; Gartner v Kidman (1962) 108 CLR 12. Liability is not strict; reasonableness of preventive steps is material.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
G.   APPLICATION OF LAW TO FACTS
16.  Mr Whiskers’ voluntary return to the Respondent’s premises and demonstrated trainability (paras 8-11) indicate that reasonable, proportionate measures can curb future incursions.  
17.  Given the short distance between properties and the existing boundary complications (Modern Survey Consultants report, 25 Jan 2024), installing physical barriers exclusively on the Respondent’s side may be impracticable. Behaviour-based solutions therefore satisfy the s 30 Companion Animals Act duty more effectively.  
18.  Historical easement arguments remain unresolved. Pending expert title advice, the Respondent does not rely on an easement defence for ongoing trespass, but notes that any residual right of passage could affect the ‘reasonableness’ calculus in nuisance (Gartner v Kidman, at 24).  
19.  The claimed damage of $4,650 is accepted as a prima-facie valuation. However, mitigation may reduce future loss, and strict liability is not triggered where reasonable steps are in progress (Robson v Hallett).  
20.  In light of Mr Whiskers’ cognitive traits, the Respondent proposes a structured Behavioural Management Plan (“BMP”) as defined below.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
H.   PROPOSED BEHAVIOURAL MANAGEMENT PLAN  
(Subject to mediation outcome and without prejudice)
21.  Indoor Containment Window  
     (a) Mr Whiskers to remain indoors from dusk to dawn, commencing [DATE TO BE CONFIRMED].  
22.  Positive-Reinforcement Training  
     (a) Six-week training program supervised by Dr Pawsworthy or her clinic delegate;  
     (b) Use of clicker-training protocol [PROTOCOL DETAILS TO BE PROVIDED].  
23.  Enriched Litter-Station Placement  
     (a) Additional litter boxes with rose-scented substrate placed within the Respondent’s property to redirect eliminatory behaviour.  
24.  Electronic Boundary Deterrent  
     (a) Installation of an ultrasonic repellent device calibrated to directionally cover the western fence line adjoining the Complainant’s roses;  
     (b) Costs borne by the Respondent.  
25.  Monitoring and Review  
     (a) Joint inspection with both parties and Council Ranger at weeks 3 and 6;  
     (b) Written progress report by Dr Pawsworthy at week 6.  
26.  Compensation  
     (a) Without admission of liability, the Respondent offers an ex-gratia payment of 50 per cent of the assessed loss ($2,325) within 14 days of a signed Mediation Agreement, contingent on acceptance of the BMP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
I.   CONCLUSION
27.  Mr Whiskers’ documented intelligence and environmental engagement justify a non-punitive, behaviour-focused resolution consonant with the spirit and letter of the Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) and the Council Bylaws.  
28.  The proposed BMP, coupled with partial compensation, is a fair, efficient, and neighbourly solution.  
29.  The Respondent respectfully requests that the Panel:  
     (a) endorse the BMP;  
     (b) note the ex-gratia offer; and  
     (c) list the matter for review no earlier than [DATE TO BE CONFIRMED] if both parties sign the Mediation Agreement.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
=== REASONING ===

Issue: Whether the Panel should approve the Respondent’s behaviour-based management plan, taking into account Mr Whiskers’ unusual intelligence and aesthetic engagement, as a reasonable measure to prevent future nuisance and resolve the dispute.

Applicable Law: Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 30-32; Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) ss 5B-5C; Willowdale Council Animal Control Bylaws cl [NUMBER]; common-law nuisance principles (Robson v Hallett [1967] 2 QB 939; Gartner v Kidman (1962) 108 CLR 12).

Application to Facts: The veterinary report and CCTV evidence (paras 8-11) demonstrate advanced cognitive traits making training effective. Implementing a BMP, partial indoor confinement, and deterrent devices constitute “reasonable measures” under s 30 Companion Animals Act. Compensation offer mitigates damages. No strict liability arises where reasonable steps are proposed and historical easement questions remain unresolved (Gartner v Kidman).

Conclusion: The Panel should endorse the BMP and accept the Respondent’s compensation offer as a proportionate, lawful resolution.

Confidence: 63%

--- Draft Review ---
## COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ACCURACY REVIEW

### 1. CITATION VERIFICATION

**Correctly Cited:**
- Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) - ✓ Valid legislation
- Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) - ✓ Valid legislation
- Robson v Hallett [1967] 2 QB 939 - ✓ Valid UK case (though see concerns below)
- Gartner v Kidman (1962) 108 CLR 12 - ✓ Valid High Court authority

**Citation Concerns:**
- The reference to "Gartner v Kidman, at 24" (para 18) needs verification - page references should be checked against the actual report
- UK authority (Robson v Hallett) used without explaining its persuasive value in NSW

### 2. LEGAL REASONING ERRORS

**Significant Issues:**

1. **Misapplication of Robson v Hallett** (paras 15, 19):
   - This case concerns police implied licence to enter property, not animal trespass/nuisance
   - No relevance to cat behaviour or owner liability
   - Should cite appropriate animal nuisance cases

2. **Incorrect interpretation of s 30** (para 17):
   - Section 30 doesn't create a general "duty" - it enables councils to issue nuisance orders
   - Mischaracterises the statutory framework
   - Should reference s 31 (nuisance cat orders) and s 32 (requirements that may be imposed)

3. **Civil Liability Act misapplication** (para 13):
   - Sections 5B-5C relate to negligence, not nuisance
   - Conflates distinct causes of action
   - Should focus on nuisance principles or specify negligence claim if relevant

### 3. PROCEDURAL ISSUES

1. **Jurisdiction unclear**:
   - No verification that "Cat Mediation Panel" exists under NSW law
   - Council bylaws cannot create quasi-judicial bodies without statutory authority
   - Should verify under Local Government Act 1993 (NSW)

2. **Missing procedural framework**:
   - No reference to mediation procedures
   - No citation of relevant ADR legislation
   - Should reference Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) Part 4 if court-annexed mediation

### 4. SUBSTANTIVE LAW CORRECTIONS

**Nuisance Law:**
- Should cite: *Hargrave v Goldman* (1963) 110 CLR 40 (reasonable precautions)
- Consider: *Sedleigh-Denfield v O'Callaghan* [1940] AC 880 (continuing nuisance)
- NSW authority: *Elston v Dore* (1982) 149 CLR 480 (private nuisance principles)

**Animal Control:**
- Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979 (NSW) may be relevant
- Local Government Act 1993 (NSW) Part 5 (approvals) and Chapter 8 (orders)
- Consider Impounding Act 1993 (NSW) if applicable

### 5. AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH COMPLIANCE

**Corrections needed:**
- "neighbor" → "neighbour" (though correctly used in document)
- "behavioral" → "behavioural" (correctly used)
- "defense" → "defence" (correctly used at para 18)
- All spelling appears compliant ✓

### 6. SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH CORRECTIONS

**Para 12:** Should read:
"Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW)
(a) s 31 empowers councils to declare a cat a nuisance cat
(b) s 32 specifies requirements that may be imposed by nuisance orders"

**Para 15:** Replace Robson v Hallett with relevant animal/nuisance authorities

**Para 19:** Remove reference to strict liability not being triggered - this conflates different legal concepts

### 7. STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

1. **Add section on standing**: Verify Ms Chen's standing as registered owner under s 8 Companion Animals Act

2. **Clarify remedies**: Distinguish between:
   - Council orders under Companion Animals Act
   - Common law nuisance remedies
   - Mediated outcomes

3. **Evidence gaps**: Multiple "[TO BE PROVIDED]" sections undermine submission credibility

### 8. RISK ASSESSMENT

**High Risk:**
- Reliance on non-existent "Cat Mediation Panel" jurisdiction
- Misapplication of Robson v Hallett
- Confusion between statutory and common law frameworks

**Medium Risk:**
- Incomplete citations and evidence
- Mixing negligence and nuisance principles

**Low Risk:**
- Minor formatting issues
- Some overstated claims about cat intelligence (though creative)

### 9. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate corrections**:
   - Remove Robson v Hallett references
   - Correct s 30 interpretation
   - Verify council bylaw provisions

2. **Additional authorities needed**:
   - NSW nuisance cases involving animals
   - Council enforcement precedents
   - ADR framework citations

3. **Practical suggestions**:
   - Complete all bracketed sections before filing
   - Obtain legal advice on "McGregor's Passage" easement
   - Consider adding fallback positions if BMP rejected

### CONCLUSION

While the submissions show creativity and practical problem-solving, they contain significant legal errors that must be corrected before filing. The core strategy (behavioural management plan) is sound, but the legal framework needs substantial revision to properly support the client's position.
