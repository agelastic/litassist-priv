1.  INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNSEL  
1.1  Tasks for directions hearing  
     a. Seek orders timetabling mandatory Cat Mediation Panel certificate (if not yet issued), pleadings, evidence exchange and mediation referral.  
     b. Preserve client’s entitlement to interlocutory injunction if trespass resumes/continues.  
     c. Resist any application by the respondent to transfer matter to NCAT unless strategically advantageous.  
     d. Obtain leave (if required) to rely on expert evidence: (i) Willowdale Garden Valuers Pty Ltd; (ii) Dr Sarah Pawsworthy BVSc; (iii) John Smith Registered Surveyor #12345.  
     e. Secure orders for joint expert conclave on boundary/easement issues, or in the alternative, sequential expert reports.  

1.2  Objectives  
     • Rapid court-supervised timetable to final resolution;  
     • Minimise procedural attacks based on easement/boundary complications;  
     • Protect heritage roses from further damage pending trial;  
     • Keep quantum within Local Court jurisdiction (presently $4,650).  

1.3  Limitations / constraints  
     • Mandatory pre-litigation Cat Mediation Panel process under Willowdale Council bylaws – certificate still awaited.  
     • Client wishes to maintain neighbourly civility where possible.  
     • Budget sensitivity: costs must not exceed likely recovery.  

1.4  Timeline / urgency  
     • Certificate from Cat Mediation Panel expected within 14 days.  
     • Garden Festival entry deadline: 1 September 2024 – client requires injunctive relief (if needed) before that date.  

2.  CASE SUMMARY  
Gerald Henderson, owner of a prize-winning heritage rose garden at 42 Rosewood Lane, alleges that Ms Margaret Chen’s cat, “Mr Whiskers”, has for six months repeatedly trespassed onto his property, defecated in rose beds and caused $4,650 of quantified damage (Willowdale Garden Valuers report, 22 Jan 2024).  Despite three oral complaints (Sept–Dec 2023) and a formal letter (15 Jan 2024) Ms Chen refuses to contain the cat, asserting “cats will be cats”, “free fertiliser” and alleged “historical access rights”.

Expert assessment (Dr Pawsworthy, 20 Jan 2024) confirms the cat is trainable; a survey (Modern Survey Consultants, 25 Jan 2024) reveals an 1887 easement (“McGregor’s Passage”) and boundary irregularities but does not negate Henderson’s possessory occupation of the garden area.

Henderson seeks damages and an injunction restraining further trespass and/or nuisance.  No court proceedings have yet been commenced; this brief is prepared in anticipation of filing a Statement of Claim and the first directions hearing.

4.  LEGAL ISSUES  
Primary  
a.  Whether repeated defecation by Mr Whiskers constitutes:  
    i. actionable private nuisance; and/or  
    ii. trespass to land.  
b.  Appropriate measure of damages for heritage roses and soil remediation.  
c.  Entitlement to injunctive relief restraining ongoing interference.  

Secondary / contingent  
d.  Effect, if any, of “McGregor’s Passage” easement on liability.  
e.  Whether Willowdale Council bylaws s 31 (cat transit rights) provide a statutory defence.  
f.  Boundary uncertainty and potential Crown land reservation.  

Issues apparently agreed – none at present.

5.  EVIDENCE SUMMARY  
5.1  Witnesses (lay)  
• Gerald Henderson – factual damage, complaints chronology.  
• Ms Margaret Chen – admissions, stance on containment (to be cross-examined).  
• [NEIGHBOUR WITNESS NAME – TO BE CONFIRMED] – observed cat activity (if available).  

5.2  Expert evidence  
• Willowdale Garden Valuers Pty Ltd – quantum of plant/soil damage (Report 22 Jan 2024).  
• Dr Sarah Pawsworthy BVSc – feline behaviour; ease of containment (Report 20 Jan 2024).  
• John Smith, Registered Surveyor #12345 – boundary/easement (Report 25 Jan 2024).  

5.3  Documentary evidence (tabbed annexures)  
A   Complaint letter 15 Jan 2024  
B   Damage valuation report 22 Jan 2024  
C   Survey report 25 Jan 2024  
D   Willowdale Council bylaws (extracts)  
E   Veterinary behavioural assessment 20 Jan 2024  
F   Photographs: “before” 2023 Festival; “after” damage  
G   CCTV footage & stills (USB – to counsel)  
H   Certificate of Title Vol 127 Folio 45 (1887 deed)  

5.4  Gaps / actions required  
• Obtain Cat Mediation Panel certificate (mandatory pre-filing).  
• Consider additional soil scientist evidence on contamination, if quantum challenged.  
• Confirm availability of any third-party neighbour witnesses.  

6.  APPLICABLE LAW  
Statutes  
• Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 30-32A (nuisance cats; owner responsibility).  
• Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) Pt 1A (negligence principles, if pleaded in alternative).  
• Local Court Act 2007 (NSW) & Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (procedural).  
• Willowdale Council Animal Control Bylaws Pt 7 ss 31-32, 47; Sch 19.  
• Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) s 88K (easement modification – background only).  

Cases (binding unless noted)  
• Sedleigh-Denfield v O’Callaghan [1940] AC 880 – continuing nuisance.  
• Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40 – duty to abate known hazard.  
• Plenty v Dillon (1991) 171 CLR 635 – trespass actionable per se.  
• League Against Cruel Sports Ltd v Scott [1986] QB 240 – animal owner liability in trespass.  
• Zhang v Hardwick [2020] NSWCATAP 206 – NCAT powers in animal neighbour disputes (persuasive).  

Principles by issue  
Issue (a) Private nuisance – substantial, unreasonable interference; reasonableness judged objectively (*Sedleigh-Denfield*).  
Issue (b) Damages – restoration/replacement cost for plants with heritage value; aggravated damages possible for highhanded disregard.  
Issue (c) Injunction – quia timet relief where damages inadequate due to irreplaceable heritage roses (*Bendal Pty Ltd v Mirvac Project Pty Ltd* (1991) 23 NSWLR 464).  
Defences – statutory cat transit rights must yield to specific heritage-protection bylaws (s 32 Sch 19).  

7.  STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1  Recommended pathway  
• File Statement of Claim in Local Court immediately upon receipt of mediation certificate; plead nuisance, trespass and in the alternative negligence; seek $4,650 plus interest and injunction.  
• Preserve option to transfer to NCAT only if Chen seeks cheaper forum and client consents.  

7.2  Alternative avenues (summary)  
• NCAT application – cost-effective but potentially weaker enforcement.  
• Council prosecution – shifts cost to Council; retains deterrent effect.  
• Easement clarification action – hold over; do not distract current claim.  

7.3  Anticipated opposing arguments & responses  
a. “Cats inherently roam; cannot control” – rebut with Dr Pawsworthy evidence of trainability and statutory duty under Companion Animals Act.  
b. “Historical access rights / easement” – easement benefits people/livestock, not companion animals; moreover, Sch 19 heritage exception overrides general transit rights.  
c. Quantum challenge – professional valuation, photographs, and Festival entry loss support figure.  

7.4  Risks / weaknesses  
• Boundary ambiguity – may invite jurisdictional or title arguments; mitigate by pleading possessory occupation and relying on damage occurring within occupied garden.  
• Costs proportionality – keep claim within Local Court scale; consider Calderbank offer post-filing.  

8.  PROCEDURAL MATTERS  
• Filing: Statement of Claim (UCPR r 6.3) – within 28 days of mediation certificate.  
• Service: personal on respondent (UCPR r 10.20).  
• Directions hearing – seek orders:  
  (i) Evidence timetable; (ii) mediation referral after defence; (iii) expert conclave; (iv) interlocutory injunction timetable if cat trespass persists.  
• Consider UCPR r 20.26 Offer of Compromise post-pleadings.  
• Filing fees: Local Court <$10,000 claim – current fee $121.

=== REASONING ===

Issue: Whether, on the presently available facts, Henderson can obtain an injunction and damages against Chen for the cat’s repeated incursions, and what procedural steps should be sought at the initial directions hearing to advance that outcome.

Applicable Law: Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 30-32A; common-law nuisance and trespass principles per Sedleigh-Denfield v O’Callaghan [1940] AC 880; Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40; Plenty v Dillon (1991) 171 CLR 635; Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) on pleadings and directions.

Application to Facts: Six months of CCTV-documented defecation, $4,650 quantified loss, three ignored complaints and expert evidence of controllability establish substantial and unreasonable interference sufficient for nuisance, and repeated direct physical entry for trespass. Statutory cat-owner duties reinforce liability. No pleaded defence defeats claim; heritage rose by-law carve-outs neutralise s 31 cat transit rights. An injunction is appropriate given ongoing risk and unique heritage value. Procedurally, a timetable for pleadings, expert evidence and mediation will progress matter efficiently.

Conclusion: Henderson has a strong prima facie case for both damages and injunctive relief. Counsel should secure a robust procedural timetable at the directions hearing, preserve expert evidence rights and guard against jurisdictional diversions.
