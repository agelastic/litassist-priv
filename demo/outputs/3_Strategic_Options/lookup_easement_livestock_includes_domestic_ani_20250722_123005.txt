### Executive Summary

Under Australian law, the term "livestock" is consistently defined and interpreted as referring to animals kept for agricultural or commercial purposes, such as the production of meat, milk, fibre, or for draught purposes. This category typically includes cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry. While the precise list can vary between statutes, the core concept remains focused on primary production. Conversely, "domestic animals" or "pets," most commonly dogs and cats, are treated as a distinct legal category, governed by separate legislative frameworks, such as state-based *Domestic Animals Acts* and local government by-laws.

In the specific context of an easement, the interpretation of its terms is paramount. The scope of an easement is determined by the express wording of the grant creating it. Where an easement specifically grants a right concerning "livestock," a court would interpret this term according to its ordinary meaning, heavily informed by the consistent statutory distinction between agricultural livestock and domestic companion animals. Consequently, a right to move "livestock" over an easement would almost certainly not be construed to include the movement of domestic pets like dogs or cats, unless the instrument contained explicit language to that effect. The analysis of provided legislation from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and the Northern Territory reveals a uniform approach that separates these classes of animals, reinforcing this interpretation.

### Comprehensive Legal Framework

An easement is a proprietary right to use land owned by another person (the servient tenement) for a specific purpose that benefits the easement holder's land (the dominant tenement). The legal framework governing the interpretation of an easement is founded on common law principles and supplemented by state and territory property legislation. The primary rule of construction is to ascertain the objective intention of the parties at the time the easement was created, as expressed in the words of the instrument of grant.

Where the language of the grant is ambiguous, courts may look to the surrounding circumstances, including the nature of the dominant and servient tenements and the purpose the easement was intended to serve. Critically, courts also refer to the established legal meaning of terms, which is often informed by statutory definitions. While a statutory definition from, for example, an agricultural act does not automatically apply to a private property instrument, it provides powerful evidence of the term's ordinary and legal meaning within that jurisdiction.

The provided sources demonstrate a clear legislative bifurcation in the regulation of animals in Australia. On one hand, numerous Acts and Regulations at the state level are dedicated to "livestock" or "stock," primarily in the context of agriculture, biosecurity, and land management. These include the *Rural Lands Protection Act 1998* (NSW) and the *Stock Diseases Act 1923* (NSW). On the other hand, a separate legislative scheme governs "domestic animals," focusing on ownership responsibilities, registration, and nuisance control within communities. This is exemplified by the framework underlying the Victorian council *Domestic Animal Management Plans*, which are created pursuant to the *Domestic Animals Act 1994* (Vic). This dual-track system is a fundamental aspect of the Australian legal framework for animal management and is crucial for interpreting terms within legal instruments like easements.

### Authority Hierarchy Analysis

The provided sources comprise a mix of primary and secondary legal authorities, which can be hierarchised as follows:

**Primary Authorities (Binding Law):**
*   **State and Territory Legislation:** Acts of Parliament are the highest form of authority provided. This includes the *Rural Lands Protection Act 1998* (NSW), the *Stock Diseases Act 1923* (NSW), the *Stock Act 1901* (NSW), the *Impounding Act 1884* (Tas), and the *Lake Bennett (Land Title) Act 2005* (NT). These Acts are binding within their respective jurisdictions and provide authoritative definitions of terms like "livestock" and "stock".
*   **Subordinate Legislation (Regulations and Environmental Planning Instruments):** These include the *Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Regulations 1990* (SA) and various *Bellingen Local Environmental Plan* instruments from NSW. These are legally binding and provide specific definitions for their regulatory purposes (e.g., land use planning), which are highly persuasive in interpreting the meaning of terms in related contexts.
*   **Local Government Laws:** The *Community Local Law 2024* from Cardinia Shire Council (Vic) is a primary legal authority, binding within that municipality. It contains specific definitions that distinguish between livestock and other animals, reflecting the council's powers delegated by state legislation.

**Secondary Authorities (Persuasive Guidance):**
*   **Government Department Publications and Webpages:** Sources such as the NSW Local Land Services' *Rural Living Handbook*, and webpages from the Queensland Government, Agriculture Victoria, and the NSW Office of Local Government, are secondary authorities. They are not law themselves but explain the government's interpretation and application of the law. They are highly persuasive as they reflect the administrative understanding of the legislative framework.
*   **Local Council Policy Documents:** The *Domestic Animal Management Plans* for Brimbank and Bayside councils (Vic) are policy documents. While not binding law in the same way as a local law, they are created to fulfil statutory obligations (under the *Domestic Animals Act 1994* (Vic)) and provide clear evidence of the operational distinction made between domestic animals and livestock at the local government level.
*   **Archival Material:** The Excel spreadsheet from the Public Record Office Victoria (*VPRS 905 Inward Registered Correspondence*) is an archival index. A review of this document confirms it does not contain any relevant legal principles, definitions, or case law pertinent to the question.

No judicial authorities (case law) were provided in the sources. Therefore, the analysis relies on the interpretation of these legislative and administrative sources.

### Detailed Case Analysis by Jurisdiction

As no case law was provided, this section provides a detailed analysis of the legislative and administrative sources by jurisdiction.

**New South Wales**
The legislative framework in NSW consistently defines "livestock" and "stock" in a manner that excludes common domestic pets.
*   The *Rural Lands Protection Act 1998* (NSW) (now repealed but indicative of long-standing definitions) defined "livestock" in Schedule 1 to include specific groups of animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and deer, as well as poultry like chickens and turkeys. This list is clearly oriented towards agricultural animals.
*   The *Stock Diseases Act 1923* (NSW) defines "Stock" in section 3(1) to mean "any cattle, horses, asses, mules, camels, sheep, swine, goats or dogs, and any animals or birds to which the provisions of this Act are applied". While "dogs" are included, they are included for the specific purpose of disease control (e.g., hydatid tapeworm) and not for a general classification as livestock. The context is biosecurity, not property access rights.
*   The *Stock Act 1901* (NSW) defines "Stock" as "any horse, mare, gelding, colt, filly, ass, mule, bull, cow, ox, heifer, steer, calf, camel, sheep, lamb, goat, or pig". This historical definition is again focused entirely on farm animals.
*   Local Environmental Plans, such as the *Bellingen Local Environmental Plan 2010*, define "livestock" for land use purposes. The standard instrument dictionary defines "livestock" as "abattoir animals, bees, deer, emus, ostriches, poultry, production animals, and anything declared by the regulations to be livestock". This is again tied to production and agriculture.
*   This is contrasted with guidance from the NSW Office of Local Government on "nuisance dogs and cats," which deals with these animals under a separate community and companion animal framework.

**Victoria**
Victorian sources draw a sharp distinction between livestock and domestic or companion animals.
*   The Cardinia Shire Council *Community Local Law 2024* provides explicit definitions. Clause 3 defines "Animal" broadly but then defines "Livestock" to include "any cattle, horse, donkey, mule, sheep, goat, pig, deer, camel, alpaca, llama or poultry" and any animal declared as such under the *Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986* (Vic). This clearly separates them from typical pets.
*   The *Domestic Animal Management Plans* for Brimbank and Bayside councils are formulated under the *Domestic Animals Act 1994* (Vic). The very existence of this Act and these plans demonstrates a separate legal regime for dogs and cats, distinct from the framework governing livestock, which is primarily managed under Agriculture Victoria's portfolio. The plans focus on registration, confinement, and nuisance issues related to pets, not agricultural animals.

**South Australia**
*   The *Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Regulations 1990* (SA), under the *Pastoral Land Management and Conservation Act 1989* (SA), define "stock" for the purposes of managing pastoral leases. Regulation 3 defines "stock" as "cattle, sheep, horses, donkeys, goats and camels". This definition is specific to the context of large-scale grazing on pastoral land and aligns with the agricultural meaning of livestock.

**Tasmania**
*   The historical *Impounding Act 1884* (Tas) in section 4 defines "Cattle" to include "any horse, mare, gelding, colt, filly, foal, ass, mule, bull, bullock, cow, steer, heifer, calf, camel, sheep, lamb, goat, and pig". This 19th-century definition, while using the term "cattle" broadly, lists animals universally recognised as stock or livestock, with no mention of companion animals.

**Northern Territory**
*   The *Lake Bennett (Land Title) Act 2005* (NT) governs a specific development. While it does not define "livestock," its by-laws in Schedule 2 are instructive. By-law 31 ("Keeping of animals") requires a resident to obtain consent to bring an animal onto the scheme land. It specifically states that this by-law does not apply to "a dog or a cat," but does apply to "any other animal". This creates a clear distinction, treating dogs and cats differently from all other animals (which would include any potential livestock), implying they are not in the same category.

### Synthesis and Conflicts Resolution

A synthesis of the provided authorities reveals a powerful and consistent legal distinction across Australian jurisdictions between "livestock" and "domestic animals." There are no material conflicts between the sources on this fundamental point. While the specific animals listed in definitions of "livestock" or "stock" may vary slightly from one statute to another (e.g., the inclusion of deer or camels), the conceptual category is uniform: it refers to animals raised for primary production, agricultural purposes, or as beasts of burden.

The core issue is one of legal interpretation within the context of a private law instrument—an easement. The resolution to the question of whether "livestock" includes "domestic animals" in this context is found by applying principles of legal construction. A court would begin with the plain, ordinary meaning of the word "livestock." This ordinary meaning is overwhelmingly informed by the statutory and administrative landscape. The fact that every reviewed jurisdiction has separate legislative and regulatory schemes for livestock (agriculture, biosecurity) and domestic animals (companion animal management, local council by-laws) is compelling evidence that the terms are not interchangeable.

Therefore, in resolving any ambiguity in an easement grant, a court would almost certainly conclude that the parties intended the term "livestock" to carry its common and statutory meaning, which is exclusive of domestic pets like dogs and cats. An argument that "livestock" should be interpreted broadly to include a pet dog would contradict the entire structure of animal-related law in Australia. The only situation where this interpretation would be displaced is if the easement grant itself contained explicit wording to the contrary, for example, "for the movement of livestock and domestic pets".

### Practical Application with Confidence Levels

**Scenario 1: An easement provides a "right of way for the purpose of moving livestock" between two farming properties.** The owner of the dominant tenement wishes to use the easement to walk their family's pet dog for recreation.
*   **Application:** This would likely not be permitted. The term "livestock" has a specific agricultural meaning, reinforced by legislation in every Australian state and territory. A pet dog is a domestic companion animal, not livestock. The purpose of the grant is tied to the movement of agricultural animals, not general or recreational access for pets.
*   **Confidence Level: High.**

**Scenario 2: An easement created in 2010 over a rural property grants a "right of way for all purposes connected with the use and enjoyment of the dominant tenement".** The dominant tenement is a farm. The owner moves cattle along the easement and also walks their dog.
*   **Application:** This would be permitted. The wording "for all purposes" is broad and not restrictive. The movement of both cattle (livestock) and a pet dog are normal incidents of the use and enjoyment of a rural property. The use must still be reasonable and not impose an excessive burden on the servient tenement.
*   **Confidence Level: High.**

**Scenario 3: An easement created in 1950 grants a right to "drove stock".** The current owner of the dominant tenement now farms alpacas, an animal not commonly farmed in Australia in 1950. They wish to move the alpacas along the easement.
*   **Application:** This is a more nuanced question of interpretation. A court would have to decide whether to apply the original meaning of "stock" from 1950 (which would not have included alpacas) or an updated, ambulatory meaning that reflects modern agricultural practices. Given that modern legislation (e.g., the Cardinia Local Law) now explicitly includes alpacas in the definition of "livestock," a court may well favour an ambulatory approach, permitting the use. However, this interpretation would still be confined to animals that fall within the modern concept of livestock and would not extend to domestic pets.
*   **Confidence Level: Medium to High** (that alpacas would be permitted); **High** (that domestic pets would not).

### Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis of the provided Australian legal sources demonstrates that the term "livestock" does not include common domestic animals such as dogs and cats. This conclusion is supported by a consistent and clear distinction maintained across a wide array of primary and secondary authorities, including state legislation, subordinate regulations, local laws, and government administrative practice in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and the Northern Territory. These sources universally define "livestock" or "stock" by reference to animals used in an agricultural or primary production context.

When interpreting the terms of an easement, Australian courts seek to give effect to the objective intention of the parties as expressed in the grant. In the absence of explicit language to the contrary, the term "livestock" will be given its ordinary and established legal meaning. Given the overwhelming weight of statutory authority separating livestock from domestic pets, an easement granting rights for the movement of "livestock" cannot be presumed to confer a right for the movement of domestic animals. For such a right to exist, it would need to be expressly stated in the instrument creating the easement.
