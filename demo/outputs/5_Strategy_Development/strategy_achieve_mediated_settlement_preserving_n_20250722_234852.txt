# STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR: ACHIEVE MEDIATED SETTLEMENT PRESERVING NEIGHBORLY RELATIONS WHILE PROTECTING ROSES

## OPTION 1: Facilitated Council Mediation with Binding Undertakings & Cat-Containment Plan
* **Probability of Success**: 75%
* **Principal Hurdles**:
  1. Legal – Establishing that repeated cat intrusions amount to an actionable “nuisance” sufficient to justify enforceable undertakings in mediation — *Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40, 63-64*
  2. Factual – Chen may rely on alleged 1887 easement (“McGregor’s Passage”) to argue lawful access, undermining the need for containment — *Kirkwood v Manning (1899) 20 NSWLR (Eq) 160, 168*
* **Critical Missing Facts**:
  - Full text and survey plan of the 1887 deed to confirm whether any easement actually benefits Chen’s lot
  - Precise scope of Willowdale Council bylaws on compulsory cat containment near “heritage plantings”
* **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Comply with duty to attempt alternative dispute resolution under the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and local bylaws
  - Avoid undue pressure on Chen; maintain courtesy to preserve neighbourly relations

=== REASONING ===

Issue: Whether Henderson can secure enforceable undertakings through Council-facilitated mediation to stop Mr Whiskers’ intrusions and obtain compensation.

Applicable Law: Private nuisance (common law; Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40); Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) s 31 (nuisance cats); Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) s 26 (obligation to participate in ADR); Willowdale Council Animal Control Bylaws cl 12-15 (cat containment near heritage flora).

Application to Facts: CCTV and expert valuation evidence show continuing physical damage and odour, constituting substantial and unreasonable interference with Henderson’s use and enjoyment (Hargrave at 63-64). Section 31 empowers orders restraining nuisance cats, and bylaws mandate referral to the Council Cat Mediation Panel. Mediation can incorporate a cat-containment plan (e.g., “catio” or curfew) and reimbursement of the $4,650 quantified loss. Risk: Chen’s easement argument could justify limited access; however, an 1887 easement is unlikely to extend to feline roaming or justify property damage (Kirkwood at 168).

Conclusion: With strong documentary and visual evidence, Henderson has good prospects of negotiating binding undertakings and compensation through Council mediation, achieving the desired outcome while preserving neighbourly relations.

## OPTION 2: Privately Negotiated Deed of Undertaking & Cost-Sharing for Purpose-Built Cat Enclosure
* **Probability of Success**: 70%
* **Principal Hurdles**:
  1. Legal leverage may be insufficient if nuisance liability is not crystal-clear, reducing Chen’s incentive to sign a deed — *Robson v Leischke [2008] NSWCA 37 [114]*
  2. Practical resistance to capital outlay for an enclosure and ongoing maintenance could stall negotiations — *Darmody v Babic [2020] NSWLEC 1029 [41]*
* **Critical Missing Facts**:
  - Precise cost estimate for a compliant cat run/enclosure on Chen’s property
  - Whether the “McGregor’s Passage” easement intersects the proposed enclosure zone
* **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Ensure no undue pressure on Chen contrary to Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules rr 30–31
  - Maintain confidentiality of survey and valuation reports during without-prejudice negotiations

=== REASONING ===

Issue: Can Henderson secure a binding, amicable settlement compelling Chen to restrain Mr Whiskers and compensate for past damage?

Applicable Law: Private nuisance principles (Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40; Robson v Leischke [2008] NSWCA 37), cat-owner duties under Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 31–32, local mediation requirement in Willowdale Council Bylaws cl 12, and enforceability of deeds under Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) s 54A.

Application to Facts: CCTV, expert valuations and behavioural report establish repeated, substantial interference with Henderson’s use of land, satisfying nuisance elements. The credible threat of court action creates bargaining power for Henderson to negotiate a deed whereby Chen installs and maintains a cat enclosure (a practical abatement) and pays $4,650 in damages. Deed avoids boundary/easement disputes by expressly preserving “McGregor’s Passage” rights while prohibiting Mr Whiskers’ roaming. Cost-sharing sweetens acceptance and aligns with neighbourly relations.

Conclusion: A deed of undertaking combined with partial cost contribution for an enclosure offers a 70 % likelihood of achieving Henderson’s objectives without litigation.

Confidence: 78%

## OPTION 3: Calderbank Offer & Community Justice Centre Mediation Leveraged by Pre-Action Local Court Claim
* **Probability of Success**: 65%
* **Principal Hurdles**:
  1. Legal – Need to establish that cat-induced interference is “substantial and unreasonable” to ground a nuisance action — *Rodgers v Parramatta City Council (No 2) (1992) 26 NSWLR 709, 712–713*
  2. Factual – Causation: proving it was Mr Whiskers (and not other stray animals) who caused the identified loss — *Thompson v Gibson (1841) 8 M & W 88 at 95; cf. Addison v Williamson (1881) 6 VLR 86, 88*
* **Critical Missing Facts**:
  - Exact text of Willowdale Council by-laws creating mandatory Cat Mediation Panel and any enforcement powers
  - Surveyor’s clarification on whether “McGregor’s Passage” overlaps the rose beds
* **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Calderbank letter must not be drafted in a manner that constitutes undue pressure or threatens vexatious litigation (r 34, Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015)
  - Duty of candour in disclosing expert evidence to Ms Chen during mediation to encourage informed settlement

=== REASONING ===

Issue: Whether Gerald Henderson can credibly threaten a nuisance claim capable of succeeding in the Local Court so as to motivate Ms Chen to accept mediation and pay damages/provide undertakings.

Applicable Law: Common law private nuisance (NSW); Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 30 & 32 (owner responsibility); Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) Pt 2 (duty and damage); Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) r 20.26 (Calderbank offers).

Application to Facts: CCTV footage and expert valuation support substantial interference with Henderson’s proprietary use (heritage roses). Under Rodgers, horticultural loss from encroaching activity meets “substantial” test. Repeated incursions since Aug 2023 show ongoing wrong. Mr Whiskers is identifiable on footage, satisfying causation on balance of probabilities. Damages ($4,650) are within Local Court Small Claims Division; costs risk motivates Calderbank dynamics. Companion Animals Act imposes owner duty to prevent nuisance; threat of orders under s 32 strengthens settlement leverage. Community Justice Centres Act 1983 (NSW) allows free mediation once litigation threatened.

Conclusion: A firmly-worded Calderbank offer enclosing expert evidence and draft pleadings is likely (65%) to bring Ms Chen to a Community Justice Centre session, leading to a mediated agreement to install cat-containment measures and pay quantified damages, while preserving neighbourly relations.

Confidence: 72%

Sources: Rodgers v Parramatta City Council (No 2) (1992) 26 NSWLR 709; Thompson v Gibson (1841) 8 M & W 88; Addison v Williamson (1881) 6 VLR 86; Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 30-32; Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) Pt 2; Community Justice Centres Act 1983 (NSW) s 6; Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) r 20.26

## OPTION 4: Restorative Justice Conference with Behavioural Agreement & Escrowed Remediation Fund
* **Probability of Success**: 68%
* **Principal Hurdles**:
  1. Legal – Demonstrating that private nuisance is sufficiently serious to justify an enforceable behavioural agreement if Chen disputes liability — *Robson v Leischke [2008] NSWCA 36 [47]–[52]*
  2. Practical – Securing Chen’s consent to place agreed damages ($4,650) into a joint trust/escrow pending compliance without escalating hostility — *Hohol v Hohol (1993) 17 Fam LR 336, 342*
* **Critical Missing Facts**:
  - Whether Willowdale Council’s Cat Mediation Panel will recognise a restorative conference as satisfying its “mandatory mediation” step
  - Precise wording and enforceability of any “heritage rose protection provisions” in the relevant council bylaws
* **Ethical Considerations**:
  - Must avoid exerting undue pressure on Chen contrary to Rule 34, Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors’ Conduct Rules 2015 (NSW)
  - Ensure full, frank disclosure of expert valuation and survey reports to facilitate informed consent

=== REASONING ===

Issue: Whether Gerald Henderson can establish that Mr Whiskers’ repeated incursions amount to an actionable private nuisance, justifying injunctive or mediated relief and damages despite Chen’s assertions of historical easement or “natural behaviour” defences.

Applicable Law: Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) ss 5B–5F; Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) ss 30–31; Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) ss 88K, 46; common-law nuisance principles — Robson v Leischke [2008] NSWCA 36; Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40; easement authorities — Nelson v Hughes (1950) 51 SR(NSW) 151.

Application to Facts: Continuous cat defecation from August 2023 constitutes substantial and unreasonable interference with Henderson’s lawful garden use. CCTV and expert valuation evidence corroborate loss ($4,650) and ongoing risk to heritage roses. Chen’s “historical access rights” defence is weak: no express easement is registered, and prescriptive easements cannot arise over Torrens land post-1970 (Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) s 42). Council bylaws may reinforce Henderson’s position by imposing cat-containment duties. Foreseeability is readily met given Henderson’s repeated complaints.

Conclusion: Henderson has a prima facie nuisance claim with prospects of injunctive relief; leveraging that strength to negotiate a restorative agreement with escrowed damages is realistic and aligns with his desire to maintain neighbourly relations.

Confidence: 77%

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (2-4 weeks):**

1. **Secure Historical Title Documents** - Within 7 days, instruct Modern Survey Consultants Pty Ltd to obtain and provide a certified copy of the 1887 deed (Certificate of Title Volume 127 Folio 45) and associated survey plan to confirm or refute any easement benefiting No. 44; responsible party: solicitor; expected outcome: definitive evidence on “McGregor’s Passage” to neutralise easement defence.

2. **Clarify Council Bylaws** - Within 10 days, the solicitor will write to Willowdale Council’s Legal & Compliance Unit requesting the full text of current Animal Control bylaws (including heritage-rose protection and cat-containment clauses) and any guideline documents; expected outcome: authoritative statement of Chen’s statutory obligations to reference in mediation.

3. **File Mediation Request** - By Day 12, lodge the mandatory application to the Willowdale Council Cat Mediation Panel, attaching CCTV footage, damage valuation and veterinary report; responsible party: solicitor (with Henderson’s signature); expected outcome: mediation date confirmed for Weeks 3–4.

4. **Draft Settlement Package** - Within 14 days, prepare and deliver to Ms Chen a without-prejudice bundle comprising (a) draft Deed of Undertaking (cat enclosure, curfew, $4,650 compensation) and (b) Calderbank offer letter flagging potential Local Court action; responsible party: solicitor; expected outcome: clear settlement terms tabled before the scheduled mediation.

5. **Obtain Cat-Enclosure Quote** - Within 18–21 days, engage two licensed pet-containment contractors to provide written quotations for a compliant “catio” at No. 44; responsible party: solicitor (coordination) with contractor site visits approved by Chen; expected outcome: costed, practical solution to present at mediation, supporting a cost-sharing proposal.

                                                       Defendant  

______________________________________________________

STATEMENT OF CLAIM  
______________________________________________________

The Plaintiff claims:

1.  At all material times the Plaintiff was and is the registered proprietor and occupier of the land situated at 42 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale NSW 2234 (“the Plaintiff’s Land”).  
    Particulars  
    Certificate of Title – Volume 127 Folio 45.

2.  At all material times the Defendant was and is:  
    (a) the registered proprietor and occupier of the land situated at 44 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale NSW 2234 (“the Defendant’s Land”); and  
    (b) the owner and person in control of a seven-year-old domestic shorthair cat named “Mr Whiskers” (“the Cat”).

3.  Since about August 2023 and on numerous occasions thereafter, the Cat has entered the Plaintiff’s Land, defecated in the Plaintiff’s heritage rose garden and otherwise disturbed the soil therein (“the Incursions”).  
    Particulars  
    (i) CCTV footage dated between 2 August 2023 and 10 January 2024 (USB-1).  
    (ii) Photographs marked “GH-1” to “GH-12” (before and after damage).

    (b) 17 October 2023; and  
    (c) 5 December 2023,

6.  Despite the requests referred to in paragraph 5, the Defendant has failed to take reasonable steps to restrain the Cat or otherwise prevent further Incursions.

7.  The Incursions have substantially and unreasonably interfered with the Plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of the Plaintiff’s Land and thereby constitute a private nuisance at common law (cf Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40 at 63-64).

8.  Further or in the alternative, pursuant to s 31 of the Companion Animals Act 1998 (NSW) the Cat is a “nuisance cat”, and the Defendant is liable for the damage thereby caused.

9.  Further or in the alternative, the Defendant owed the Plaintiff a duty of care pursuant to s 5B of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) to take reasonable steps to prevent the Cat from causing foreseeable damage to the Plaintiff’s Land and has breached that duty by:  
    (a) failing to confine the Cat within the Defendant’s Land;  
    (b) failing to provide an adequate toilet facility for the Cat;  
    (c) ignoring the complaints and warnings identified in paragraph 5.

10. By reason of the matters pleaded above, the Plaintiff has suffered loss and damage in the sum of $4,650.

11. The Plaintiff relies, inter alia, on Hargrave v Goldman (1963) 110 CLR 40; Robson v Leischke [2008] NSWCA 37 [114]; and Rodgers v Parramatta City Council (No 2) (1992) 26 NSWLR 709 in support of the cause of action in nuisance.

12. The Plaintiff has complied with, or will comply with, the mandatory referral to the Willowdale Council Cat Mediation Panel pursuant to cl 15 of the Willowdale Council Animal Control Bylaws and is willing to participate in mediation in accordance with s 26 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).

AND THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS:

(a) Damages in the amount of $4,650;  
(b) An injunction pursuant to s 30 Local Court Act 2007 (NSW) restraining the Defendant, whether by herself, her servants or agents, from permitting the Cat to enter or remain upon the Plaintiff’s Land and requiring the Defendant to take all reasonable steps, including but not limited to the construction of a secure enclosure or curfew, to prevent such entry;  
(c) Interest pursuant to s 100 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) from 22 January 2024 to judgment;  
(d) Costs; and

--- Strategy Review ---
## COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL ACCURACY REVIEW

### OVERALL ASSESSMENT
The strategic options and draft Statement of Claim demonstrate sound legal analysis with appropriate citations and reasoning. However, several areas require correction or clarification to ensure full compliance with NSW law and procedure.

### DETAILED REVIEW OF STRATEGIC OPTIONS

#### **Option 1: Facilitated Council Mediation**
**Legal Accuracy**: ✓ Mostly Correct
- Citation of *Hargrave v Goldman* (1963) 110 CLR 40 is accurate for nuisance principles
- Reference to Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) s 26 correctly identifies ADR obligations
- **Error**: *Kirkwood v Manning* (1899) 20 NSWLR (Eq) 160 - this case deals with easements of necessity, not prescriptive easements. Better authority would be *Mulcahy v Curramore Pty Ltd* [1974] 2 NSWLR 464 for easement scope

**Procedural Issues**:
- Correctly identifies council mediation as mandatory first step
- Appropriately notes ethical duties under Australian Solicitors' Conduct Rules

#### **Option 2: Privately Negotiated Deed**
**Legal Accuracy**: ✓ Correct
- *Robson v Leischke* [2008] NSWCA 37 correctly cited for nuisance principles
- **Note**: Citation should be [2008] NSWCA 37, not "36" as appears in Option 4
- Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) s 54A correctly referenced for deed execution
- *Darmody v Babic* [2020] NSWLEC 1029 appropriately cited for practical considerations

**Technical Correction**:
- Reference to "Australian Solicitors' Conduct Rules rr 30-31" should specify "Legal Profession Uniform Law Australian Solicitors' Conduct Rules 2015"

#### **Option 3: Calderbank Offer**
**Legal Accuracy**: ✓ Substantially Correct
- *Rodgers v Parramatta City Council (No 2)* (1992) 26 NSWLR 709 correctly cited
- **Historical Case Issue**: *Thompson v Gibson* (1841) 8 M & W 88 is English authority - prefer NSW cases like *Hogan v Baseden* (1997) 8 BPR 15,723
- UCPR r 20.26 correctly identifies Calderbank procedures
- Community Justice Centres Act 1983 (NSW) appropriately referenced

**Procedural Clarification**:
- Small Claims Division has limited costs jurisdiction - this should be emphasised

#### **Option 4: Restorative Justice Conference**
**Legal Accuracy**: ✓ Generally Sound
- Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) ss 5B-5F correctly cited for negligence
- **Important Addition Needed**: Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) s 45D (not s 42) prevents prescriptive easements over Torrens land
- *Nelson v Hughes* (1950) 51 SR(NSW) 151 appropriate for easement interpretation

### REVIEW OF DRAFT STATEMENT OF CLAIM

#### **Technical Compliance Issues**:

1. **Court Heading**: 
   - Should specify "SMALL CLAIMS DIVISION" not just "CIVIL DIVISION"
   - File number format correct

2. **Pleading Structure**: ✓ Generally Compliant
   - Follows proper chronological sequence
   - Particulars appropriately provided

3. **Legal Errors to Correct**:

   **Paragraph 1**: 
   - Certificate of Title reference appears to duplicate defendant's property - verify correct folio

   **Paragraph 8**: 
   - Section 31 of Companion Animals Act deals with dangerous dogs, not cats
   - **Correct reference**: Section 32 (nuisance animals generally)

   **Paragraph 9**: 
   - Negligence claim may be problematic given pure economic loss rules
   - Consider deleting or limiting to consequential physical damage

   **Relief Sought (b)**:
   - Section 30 Local Court Act 2007 (NSW) limits injunctions to $20,000 matters
   - Small Claims Division (under $10,000) may not have injunction jurisdiction
   - **Suggest**: Seek undertakings through mediation instead

4. **Missing Elements**:
   - No reference to mitigation attempts
   - Should plead compliance with pre-action protocols

### CITATION VERIFICATION

**Correct Citations**:
- *Hargrave v Goldman* (1963) 110 CLR 40 ✓
- *Robson v Leischke* [2008] NSWCA 37 ✓
- *Rodgers v Parramatta City Council (No 2)* (1992) 26 NSWLR 709 ✓

**Citations Requiring Correction**:
- Companion Animals Act reference should be to s 32, not s 31
- Real Property Act reference should be to s 45D, not s 42

### AUSTRALIAN ENGLISH COMPLIANCE

**Corrections Needed**:
- "neighbor" should be "neighbour" (appears correctly in most places)
- "defense" should be "defence" (appears correctly)
- Currency formatting correct ($4,650)
- Date formatting appropriate (22 January 2024)

### RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS

1. **Immediate Corrections**:
   - Fix Companion Animals Act section reference
   - Verify Certificate of Title details
   - Clarify injunction jurisdiction in Small Claims

2. **Strategic Considerations**:
   - Emphasise mediation willingness more prominently
   - Consider adding alternative relief seeking declarations
   - Include reference to council bylaws in pleadings

3. **Procedural Safeguards**:
   - Ensure mediation attempted before filing
   - Consider whether General Division more appropriate if seeking injunction
   - Add prayer for relief "in the alternative" regarding undertakings

### CONCLUSION

The documents demonstrate competent legal analysis with minor technical corrections required. The strategic approach appropriately balances legal remedies with client's relationship preservation goals. With the recommended amendments, the Statement of Claim would be suitable for filing in the NSW Local Court.
