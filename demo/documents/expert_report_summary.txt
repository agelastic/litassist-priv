EXPERT REPORT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Dr. James Wu, Cloud Infrastructure Specialist

Engaged by: TechStart Pty Ltd
Matter: TechStart v CloudCorp
Date: 1 December 2023

OPINION SUMMARY:

1. INFRASTRUCTURE ANALYSIS
The October 2023 outage resulted from fundamental architectural flaws in 
CloudCorp's Sydney data center. Key findings:
- No proper failover mechanisms between availability zones
- Single point of failure in network routing
- Inadequate backup power systems

2. INDUSTRY STANDARDS
CloudCorp's infrastructure falls below industry standards:
- AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud all maintain redundant systems
- 99.9% uptime requires N+2 redundancy (CloudCorp had N+0)
- 52-hour recovery time indicates absence of disaster recovery planning

3. SERVICE LEVEL COMPLIANCE
Based on logs analyzed:
- Actual uptime for October 2023: 92.8%
- Annual uptime projection: 97.2%
- This represents a material breach of the 99.9% guarantee

4. CAUSATION
The extended outage was preventable with proper:
- Infrastructure investment
- Redundancy planning
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Competent technical management

CONCLUSION:
CloudCorp's service fell materially below both contractual requirements and 
industry standards, demonstrating negligence in infrastructure management.
