Subject: URGENT: Complete service outage - need immediate response

Michael,

Our entire platform has been down since 3 AM. This is catastrophic - we process 
over $2M in payments daily. Our customers cannot access their accounts.

We've raised critical ticket #4521. No response after 6 hours.

This is completely unacceptable. Call me immediately.

Sarah Chen
CEO, TechStart

Sarah,

I've just seen your email. I'm escalating this internally. The technical team 
is investigating what appears to be a major infrastructure failure affecting 
multiple customers.

I'll update you within 2 hours.

Michael,

It's been over 24 hours. We're losing customers. The Financial Times is asking 
for comment about our "system failures."

Your 99.9% uptime guarantee is meaningless if you can't even respond to critical 
issues. We've had to tell customers their funds are "temporarily inaccessible" - 
do you understand the regulatory implications?

If service isn't restored by EOD, we'll be seeking emergency court orders.

Subject: Ticket #4521 - Service Restored

Dear Valued Customer,

We are pleased to inform you that service has been restored. The issue was caused 
by a cascading failure in our Sydney data center.

As per our Service Level Agreement, service credits will be applied to your account.

Thank you for your patience.
