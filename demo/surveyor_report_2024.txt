RE: Boundary Determination - 42 & 44 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale

Date: 25 January 2024

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

We were engaged to determine the exact boundary between the properties, particularly 
regarding "McGregor's Passage." Our findings are... concerning.

KEY FINDINGS:

1. The "Grandfather Oak" mentioned in the 1887 deed appears to be a fig tree that has 
   "walked" approximately 15 meters south due to root growth patterns.

2. The iron spike has been located using metal detection - it is 23 meters from where 
   it should be based on the deed description.

3. The "natural spring" was filled in 1953 and is now under the Willowdale Shopping 
   Centre car park.

4. Using modern GPS survey techniques and historical map overlays, we have determined 
   that BOTH properties may be situated on what was originally designated as Crown Land 
   reserved for "future railway purposes."

5. McGregor's Passage, if it exists, would run directly through both houses' living rooms.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Do NOT lodge any adverse possession claims
- Consider quiet enjoyment provisions
- Suggest mediation before authorities notice this situation
- Under no circumstances alert the Department of Crown Lands

DISCLAIMER: This report is provided "as is" and should not be construed as legal 
advice. We recommend immediate consultation with a property law specialist familiar 
with colonial-era descriptions and their modern interpretations.
