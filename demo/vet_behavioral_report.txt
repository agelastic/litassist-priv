WILLOWDALE VETERINARY CLINIC
Behavioral Assessment Report

Patient: Mr. Whiskers Chen
Species: Felis catus
Age: 7 years
Date: 20 January 2024

BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT:

Mr. Whiskers presents as a well-adjusted domestic shorthair with above-average 
intelligence and strong territorial instincts.

Key Observations:
1. Marking Behavior: Patient exhibits selective marking behavior, showing preference 
   for highly cultivated garden areas. This suggests aesthetic appreciation unusual 
   in felines.

2. Deterrent Response: When exposed to ultrasonic deterrent (in clinic), patient 
   showed no distress but appeared "amused" (Note: anthropomorphization for client 
   communication purposes).

3. Historical Memory: Patient immediately walked to northeast corner of examination 
   room - the exact direction of the disputed rose garden. Suggests strong spatial 
   memory and established routine.

4. Intelligence Testing: Solved puzzle feeder in 3.2 seconds (clinic record). IQ 
   estimated at 127 (human-equivalent scale).

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Physical barriers ineffective due to patient's problem-solving abilities
- Suggest environmental modification (make roses less attractive)
- Alternative: Provide designated toileting area with similar substrate
- Consider mediation with animal communicator

LEGAL NOTE: This assessment does not constitute evidence of intent or malice. Cats 
cannot form criminal intent under NSW law (see R v Mittens [1982] NSWSC 44).
