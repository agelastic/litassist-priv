LETTER OF COMPLAINT

From: Gerald Henderson
      42 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale NSW 2234
To:   Ms. Margaret Chen
      44 Rosewood Lane, Willowdale NSW 2234

Date: 15 January 2024

Dear Ms. Chen,

I write regarding your cat, Mr. Whiskers, and his repeated trespass onto my property.

For the past six months, Mr. Whiskers has been using my heritage rose garden as his 
personal toilet facility. My roses, including the prize-winning 'Queen Elizabeth' that 
won Best in Show at the 2023 Willowdale Garden Festival, have been destroyed.

The damage includes:
- 12 heritage roses killed (valued at $200 each)
- Contamination of organic soil (replacement cost $500)
- Mental distress from losing 30 years of cultivation work
- Inability to enter the 2024 Garden Festival

I have attempted to discuss this matter with you on several occasions:
- 3 September 2023: You said "cats will be cats"
- 17 October 2023: You suggested I "should appreciate the free fertilizer"
- 5 December 2023: You claimed Mr. Whiskers has "historical access rights"

I have installed a $300 ultrasonic cat deterrent which Mr. Whiskers ignores. I have 
CCTV footage of him deliberately walking past it while maintaining eye contact with 
the camera.

Please keep Mr. Whiskers confined to your property. If this continues, I will have no 
choice but to pursue legal remedies.

Yours sincerely,
Gerald Henderson

P.S. Your mention of "historical access rights" prompted me to check my property deeds. 
We need to discuss the boundary situation.
