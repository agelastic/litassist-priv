# Comprehensive Case Document Generation Plan

This plan generates 50+ documents for the Osipov v Wong vehicle ownership dispute, maximizing coverage for downstream strategy analysis.

## PHASE 1: BRAINSTORMING (generates orthodox & unorthodox strategies automatically)
```bash
litassist brainstorm case_facts.txt --side plaintiff --area civil
```

## PHASE 2: EXTRACT FACTS FROM SOURCE DOCUMENTS
Extract structured facts from all PDF documents in the case bundle with a single command:

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT FILE SIZE LIMIT**: Each file must be under 1MB (1,000,000 characters). Large files like WhatsApp chat logs should be processed with `digest` instead.

```bash
# Process PDFs and case_facts together (if under 1MB each)
litassist extractfacts case_facts.txt *.pdf

# For large files like WhatsApp logs, use digest separately
litassist digest whatsapp_chat_log.txt --mode summary --hint "vehicle ownership gift discussions money transfers"
```

### Recommended Approach for Mixed Document Types:
```bash
# Step 1: Extract facts from structured documents
litassist extractfacts case_facts.txt car_bundle.pdf suncorp_bundle.pdf

# Step 2: Digest large/conversational files separately  
litassist digest whatsapp_chat_log.txt --mode issues --hint "gift intent ownership discussions"

# Step 3: Manually incorporate key findings from digest into case_facts.txt if needed
```

Note: extractfacts creates structured 10-heading output ideal for legal commands, while digest handles large unstructured content better.

## PHASE 3: EXTENSIVE CASE LAW RESEARCH (15+ research files)

### Gift elements research
```bash
litassist lookup "gift valid elements delivery acceptance donative intent motor vehicle" --mode irac --comprehensive
litassist lookup "incomplete gift presumed resulting trust vehicle registration ownership" --mode irac --comprehensive
litassist lookup "gift delivery constructive symbolic motor vehicle keys possession" --mode irac
```

### Presumption of advancement research  
```bash
litassist lookup "presumption advancement de facto relationship same-sex couples property" --mode irac --comprehensive
litassist lookup "presumption advancement rebuttal evidence contrary intention" --mode irac
litassist lookup "matrimonial cause de facto property settlement time limits ACT" --mode irac
```

### Alternative claims research
```bash
litassist lookup "detinue motor vehicle possession wrongful detention ACT law" --mode irac
litassist lookup "conversion trespass goods motor vehicle damages ACT" --mode irac
litassist lookup "constructive trust unjust enrichment vehicle purchase" --mode irac --comprehensive
litassist lookup "resulting trust purchase money motor vehicle registration" --mode irac
```

### Equitable defences research
```bash
litassist lookup "laches acquiescence delay family violence order restraining order excuse" --mode irac --comprehensive
litassist lookup "estoppel representation ownership motor vehicle conduct" --mode irac
litassist lookup "clean hands doctrine equity misconduct assault charges" --mode irac
```

### Procedural research
```bash
litassist lookup "ACT Magistrates Court civil jurisdiction equitable remedies sections 257 258" --mode irac
litassist lookup "service process family violence order legal practitioner exemption ACT" --mode irac
```

### Extract specific information
```bash
litassist lookup "gift motor vehicle de facto relationship ACT cases" --extract citations
litassist lookup "presumption advancement same-sex relationships" --extract principles
litassist lookup "detinue conversion motor vehicle remedies" --extract checklist
```

## PHASE 4: DIGEST DOCUMENTS (create summaries and issue spotting)
```bash
# Process all PDFs and text files in the directory
litassist digest *.pdf whatsapp_chat.txt --mode summary
litassist digest *.pdf whatsapp_chat.txt --mode issues --hint "ownership gift presumption advancement"

# Or process specific files
litassist digest car_bundle.pdf suncorp_bundle.pdf whatsapp_chat.txt --mode summary
```
Note: digest now accepts multiple files and creates a consolidated digest with clear source attribution for each document.

## PHASE 5: RESEARCH-INFORMED BRAINSTORMING (with lookup results)
After completing extensive case law research, run brainstorm again with research context:

### üéØ RECOMMENDED for Osipov v Wong case:
```bash
# Use selective research themes focusing on core legal theories
litassist brainstorm case_facts.txt --side plaintiff --area civil --research outputs/lookup_*gift*.txt --research outputs/lookup_*presumption*.txt --research outputs/lookup_*constructive*.txt
```

**Why this approach is best:**
- Focuses on the three core legal theories: gift elements, presumption of advancement, and constructive trust
- Avoids information overload from procedural/peripheral research
- Keeps strategies targeted on strongest arguments
- Prevents token limit issues

### Alternative approaches (less recommended):
```bash
# Option 2: Use ALL research (may be too broad)
litassist brainstorm case_facts.txt --side plaintiff --area civil --research outputs/lookup_*.txt

# Option 3: Use extracted facts with selective research
litassist brainstorm outputs/extractfacts_*.txt --side plaintiff --area civil --research outputs/lookup_*gift*.txt --research outputs/lookup_*presumption*.txt --research outputs/lookup_*constructive*.txt
```

Note: The --research flag enriches orthodox strategies with case law precedents while maintaining creative unorthodox strategies. This creates a second brainstorm output that combines early creativity with later research insights.

## PHASE 6: COUNSEL NOTES (from multiple sources)
Wait for brainstorm output files (both early and research-informed), then:
```bash
# Basic version with original case facts
litassist counselnotes outputs/brainstorm_*.txt case_facts.txt

# With extracted facts from PDFs
litassist counselnotes outputs/brainstorm_*.txt outputs/extractfacts_*.txt

# With research files
litassist counselnotes outputs/brainstorm_*.txt outputs/lookup_*.txt --extract all

# Comprehensive version with all sources
litassist counselnotes outputs/brainstorm_*.txt outputs/lookup_*.txt outputs/digest_*.txt outputs/extractfacts_*.txt --extract principles --verify
```

## PHASE 7: BAR BRIEFS (multiple versions with research)
Note: Can use either early brainstorm or research-informed brainstorm strategies, or both:

### Basic version
```bash
litassist barbrief case_facts.txt --strategies outputs/brainstorm_*.txt --hearing trial
```

### With research files
```bash
litassist barbrief case_facts.txt --strategies outputs/brainstorm_*.txt --research outputs/lookup_*gift*.txt --research outputs/lookup_*presumption*.txt --hearing trial
```

### Comprehensive version
```bash
litassist barbrief case_facts.txt --strategies outputs/brainstorm_*.txt --research outputs/lookup_*.txt --supporting "/Users/witt/Desktop/litassist/Car Docs for civil case 2025/*.pdf" --instructions "Focus on rebutting presumption of advancement and establishing incomplete gift" --hearing trial --verify
```

## PHASE 8: STRATEGY ANALYSES

### Basic strategy
```bash
litassist strategy case_facts.txt --outcome "Recover vehicle purchase price of $40,364 from Marcus Wong"
```

### With brainstormed strategies
```bash
litassist strategy case_facts.txt --outcome "Recover vehicle purchase price through detinue or conversion claim" --strategies outputs/brainstorm_*.txt
```

### Multiple strategy runs with different outcomes
```bash
litassist strategy case_facts.txt --outcome "Establish resulting trust over vehicle"
litassist strategy case_facts.txt --outcome "Obtain order for return of vehicle or damages"
litassist strategy case_facts.txt --outcome "Rebut presumption of advancement and prove incomplete gift"
```

## PHASE 9: DRAFT DOCUMENTS

### Draft various documents using RAG
```bash
litassist draft case_facts.txt outputs/strategy_*.txt "Draft originating application for ACT Magistrates Court seeking declaration of ownership and damages for detinue" --verify

litassist draft case_facts.txt outputs/barbrief_*.txt "Draft comprehensive legal submissions on incomplete gift and presumption of advancement" --verify

litassist draft case_facts.txt outputs/counselnotes_*.txt "Draft witness statement for Vitaly Osipov covering all aspects of vehicle purchase" --verify

litassist draft case_facts.txt outputs/strategy_*.txt outputs/lookup_*.txt "Draft memorandum of advice on prospects of success" --diversity 0.8
```

### Alternative drafts
```bash
litassist draft case_facts.txt "Draft letter before action to Marcus Wong demanding return of vehicle"
litassist draft case_facts.txt outputs/brainstorm_*.txt "Draft particulars of claim for conversion and detinue"
litassist draft case_facts.txt outputs/barbrief_*.txt "Draft opening submissions for trial"
```

## PHASE 10: EXTRACT FACTS (from all generated documents)
```bash
# Extract facts from all generated documents in one command
litassist extractfacts outputs/brainstorm_*.txt outputs/barbrief_*.txt outputs/strategy_*.txt outputs/counselnotes_*.txt

# Or process each type separately if needed
litassist extractfacts outputs/brainstorm_*.txt
litassist extractfacts outputs/barbrief_*.txt outputs/draft_*.txt
```

## PHASE 11: VERIFICATION OF KEY DOCUMENTS
```bash
litassist verify outputs/draft_*application*.txt --citations
litassist verify outputs/draft_*submissions*.txt --soundness --reasoning
litassist verify outputs/draft_*memorandum*.txt
```

## PHASE 12: RESEARCH SYNTHESIS (Consolidate all research findings)
Create intermediate synthesis documents to consolidate the extensive research:

### Step 1: Synthesize all legal research
```bash
# Combine all lookup research and digest findings into a research synthesis
litassist counselnotes outputs/lookup_*.txt outputs/digest_*.txt outputs/extractfacts_*.txt --extract all --verify
# This creates: outputs/counselnotes_lookup_digest_extractfacts_[timestamp].txt
```

### Step 2: Synthesize strategic materials
```bash
# Combine brainstormed strategies with the research synthesis
litassist counselnotes outputs/brainstorm_*.txt outputs/counselnotes_lookup_*.txt --extract principles
# This creates: outputs/counselnotes_brainstorm_counselnotes_[timestamp].txt
```

### Step 3: Create final comprehensive synthesis
```bash
# Combine everything including barbrief into final synthesis
litassist counselnotes outputs/counselnotes_brainstorm_*.txt outputs/barbrief_*.txt outputs/draft_*.txt --verify
# This creates: outputs/counselnotes_counselnotes_barbrief_draft_[timestamp].txt
```

## PHASE 13: FINAL COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY
Use the synthesized documents to create the master strategy:
```bash
# Now strategy command can use the comprehensive synthesis
litassist strategy case_facts.txt --outcome "Comprehensive recovery of vehicle value through all available causes of action" --strategies outputs/counselnotes_counselnotes_barbrief_*.txt --verify
```

## PHASE 14: FINAL INTEGRATION DOCUMENT (Optional but Recommended)
For the most comprehensive integration, use draft command which can access ALL files:
```bash
# Create final strategic litigation roadmap using ALL outputs
litassist draft outputs/case_facts_*.txt outputs/extractfacts_*.txt outputs/brainstorm_*.txt outputs/lookup_*.txt outputs/counselnotes_*.txt outputs/barbrief_*.txt outputs/strategy_*.txt outputs/digest_*.txt outputs/draft_*.txt "Create comprehensive strategic litigation roadmap synthesizing all research, analysis, strategies, and recommendations for recovering vehicle value through all available causes of action" --verify
```

## Notes
- All outputs are automatically timestamped and saved in the `outputs/` directory (note: "outputs" not "output")
- Use wildcards (*.txt) to reference timestamped output files
- The dual brainstorming approach:
  - **Phase 1**: Early creative brainstorm based purely on case facts (generates initial creative thinking)
  - **Phase 5**: Research-informed brainstorm using --research flag (enhances orthodox strategies with precedents)
  - Both generate separate output files with orthodox and unorthodox strategies
  - Each also creates 3 additional reasoning trace files: *_orthodox_reasoning.txt, *_unorthodox_reasoning.txt, *_analysis_reasoning.txt
- The `strategy` command creates an additional *_reasoning.txt file
- The `barbrief` command may create *_reasoning.txt files
- Brainstorm ALWAYS performs verification automatically (no --verify flag needed or accepted)
- Many other commands have automatic verification enabled (extractfacts, barbrief, strategy)
- Commands can accept multiple input files for comprehensive analysis

## Synthesis Approach (Option B)
This workflow implements a multi-stage synthesis approach to overcome the strategy command's limitation of only accepting one case facts file and one strategies file:
1. **Phase 12**: Creates three levels of synthesis using counselnotes to consolidate ~50 documents into digestible summaries
2. **Phase 13**: The strategy command uses the final synthesis document, ensuring it's informed by all research
3. **Phase 14**: Optional but recommended - uses draft command for true comprehensive integration since it can access ALL files directly

The dual brainstorming approach (Phase 1 and Phase 5) ensures:
- Early creative strategies are not constrained by existing case law
- Later research-informed strategies benefit from comprehensive legal precedents
- Maximum strategic coverage through both approaches

## Key Commands and Their Input Capabilities
- `extractfacts`: NOW accepts multiple files - consolidates into single fact sheet (IMPROVED!)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Each file must be under 1MB limit
- `digest`: NOW accepts multiple files - creates consolidated digest with source attribution (IMPROVED!)
  - Better for large files and unstructured content
- `strategy`: Only accepts 1 case facts file + 1 optional strategies file (LIMITED)
- `counselnotes`: Accepts multiple files (GOOD for synthesis)
- `barbrief`: Accepts case facts + strategies + multiple research files via --research flag
- `draft`: Accepts unlimited files with RAG support (BEST for final integration)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### File Too Large Error
**Problem**: "Source file too large (X characters). Please provide a file under 1,000,000 characters."

**Solution**: 
1. Use `digest` instead of `extractfacts` for large files
2. Split large files into smaller chunks
3. Extract only relevant portions of chat logs/correspondence

### Handling Mixed Document Types
**Best Practice**:
- Structured legal documents (contracts, affidavits) ‚Üí `extractfacts`
- Large conversational files (WhatsApp, emails) ‚Üí `digest` with `--hint`
- Combine insights manually in case_facts.txt
