# LitAssist Logs

This directory contains audit logs from LitAssist commands in Markdown format.

Log files are automatically generated with timestamps when commands are executed:
- `command_YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` - Command audit logs with inputs, outputs, and usage statistics

These files can be safely deleted and will be regenerated as needed.
