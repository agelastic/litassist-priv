# Progress

## What works
- **All Core Commands**: lookup, digest, extractfacts, brainstorm, strategy, draft, verify, counselnotes, barbrief fully implemented and stable
- **Barbrief Command (January 2025)**: Comprehensive barrister's brief generation
  - 10-section structured brief format (Cover Sheet through Annexures)
  - Validates 10-heading case facts format from extractfacts
  - Multiple input support: strategies, research reports, supporting documents
  - Hearing-type specific formatting: trial, directions, interlocutory, appeal
  - LLMClientFactory integration: openai/o3-pro with 32K token limit
  - Citation verification integration with --verify flag
  - Comprehensive error handling for API failures
  - Full integration test suite and documentation
- **CounselNotes Command (January 2025)**: Complete strategic analysis implementation
  - Five-section strategic framework: Overview, Opportunities, Risks, Recommendations, Management
  - Four JSON extraction modes: all, citations, principles, checklist
  - Multi-document cross-synthesis with intelligent chunk consolidation
  - LLMClientFactory integration: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4, temp=0.3, top_p=0.7, force_verify=True
  - Professional Australian legal context and advocate perspective analysis
  - Citation verification integration with existing dual-layer system
  - Comprehensive documentation and test coverage
- Digest command supports optional --hint argument (June 2025): users can provide a text hint to focus LLM analysis on topics related to the hint, enabling targeted processing of non-legal and general documents.
- Comprehensive post-hoc verification (June 2025): `verify` command performs citation accuracy, legal soundness, and reasoning transparency checks on generated documents. Each check writes a separate timestamped report to outputs/. All steps use the existing logging infrastructure and minimal console output.
- Research-informed brainstorming (June 2025): `brainstorm` command supports `--research` option to inject lookup report(s) into the orthodox strategies prompt, enabling research-grounded strategy generation. All prompt logic is managed in YAML; no hardcoded LLM templates.
- Major June 2025 improvements complete:
  - Lookup command overhaul: Jade.io-only, --comprehensive flag, improved extract options with JSON-first parsing, --context flag, citation integration, code quality/linting
  - Multi-section reasoning traces for brainstorm; enhanced strategy integration
  - Complete timing coverage and comprehensive logging for all operations
  - Centralized configuration and log format in config.yaml
  - Clean CLI output and professional summaries
  - Output file timestamping and organization in outputs/ and logs/
  - Model selection and BYOK requirements for advanced commands
  - Two-phase citation verification and selective regeneration (“Option B”)
- Robust test suite (unit and integration tests), ruff linting passing
- Documentation and Memory Bank fully aligned with codebase and user guides
- Counselnotes command LLMClientFactory integration complete (January 2025):
  - Added missing configuration entry to COMMAND_CONFIGS
  - Uses anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 with temperature=0.3, top_p=0.7
  - Enables force_verify=True for strategic analysis verification
  - Eliminates "No configuration found" warning
  - Aligns with brainstorm-orthodox pattern for strategic analysis

## What’s left to build
- Implement advanced features from LLM_IMPROVEMENTS.md (e.g., IRAC/MIRAT enforcement, multi-model consensus, confidence scoring)
- Develop integration tests for OpenRouter and extended RAG workflows
- Add cost-tracking, quality-tier system, and workflow compound commands
- Enhance QA loops (adversarial testing, iterative improvement loops) and performance benchmarking
- Continue to update Memory Bank after each major feature, bugfix, or workflow change

## Current status
**Feature Complete**: All core commands including counselnotes and barbrief are implemented and production-ready. Currently on `feature/barbrief-command` branch after completing barbrief implementation. Memory Bank, documentation, and codebase fully synchronized. Barbrief completes the litigation document preparation pipeline, providing comprehensive brief generation for Australian barristers.

## Known issues
- Several advanced prompting and verification improvements remain unimplemented
- Integration testing for OpenRouter and Pinecone cleanup not yet automated
- Cost-tracking and quality-tier features absent
- TODO.md contains additional feature items and technical debt tasks

## Evolution of project decisions
- Core pipeline implemented first, followed by citation verification enhancements and workflow clarifications
- Configuration and logging centralized from CLI flags to config.yaml for consistency
- Lookup command simplified to Jade.io only to avoid anti-bot issues; --comprehensive flag and extract options added
- Clean CLI output, timestamped files, and professional summaries adopted as standard UX
- Brainstorm vs strategy distinction clarified; integration pattern formalized
- Two-phase citation verification and selective regeneration (“Option B”) established as quality control standard
- Post-hoc verification (verify command) added to enable comprehensive quality checks on generated documents, including citation, legal soundness, and reasoning trace validation.
- Memory Bank practice formalized to preserve context and support onboarding after session resets
