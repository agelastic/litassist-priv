# Progress

## Recent Developments (July 2025)

- **Infrastructure & Architecture Improvements (July 18)**
  - Added comprehensive architectural documentation (`ARCHITECTURE Codex.md` and `ARCHITECTURE Gemini.md`) detailing system design, component relationships, and data flow.
  - Implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing on pull requests (Python 3.11 and 3.12).
  - Added pre-commit hooks for running pytest with fast-fail on every commit.
  - Enhanced caseplan command to generate executable bash scripts extracting all CLI commands from workflow plans.
  - Created comprehensive LaTeX article documenting the LitAssist workflow system.
  - Updated .gitignore with comprehensive development patterns for better workspace management.

- **Testing Infrastructure Updates (July 18)**
  - Replaced `tempfile` with pytest's `tmp_path` fixture throughout unit tests for better test isolation.
  - Added new unit tests: `test_digest_command.py`, `test_extractfacts_command.py`, `test_utils_additional.py`.
  - Updated Python version requirement to >=3.11 (from 3.8) aligning with modern Python features.
  - Enhanced test coverage for barbrief and caseplan commands.
  - Refined project licensing information in setup.py.

- **Documentation & Planning (July 15-18)**
  - Created multiple analysis and planning documents: CLI coloring fix plan, high priority bugfix plan, model configuration updates.
  - Moved various Claude analysis documents to `docs/development/` for better organization.
  - Added comprehensive analysis of caseplan command enhancements and switch standardization plans.

- **Large Document Handling & Token Counting (July 13)**
  - Implemented chunk-based processing in `digest` and `strategy` commands (50k token chunks) to handle large legal documents and avoid API token limits.
  - Integrated `tiktoken` for accurate token counting in research file analysis and input size management.
  - Brainstorm command now analyzes research file size, warns users for >128k tokens, and displays file/token/word stats.
  - All commands updated to use improved error handling and user feedback for large input files.

- **Verification & Model Upgrades (July 13)**
  - Switched verification system to Claude 4 Opus for higher accuracy and context window.
  - Broadened citation search scope and increased file size limits for extractfacts and lookup commands.
  - Two-phase citation verification and selective regeneration remain standard.

- **Prompt & Policy Refinements (July 13)**
  - Major prompt YAML updates: barbrief.yaml, strategies.yaml, verification.yaml, caseplan.yaml, formats.yaml, glob_help_addon.yaml, lookup.yaml, system_feedback.yaml.
  - Enforced zero-emoji policy and standardized ASCII/ANSI output across all commands and documentation.
  - Improved code formatting and removed unused imports (e.g., verifying_message from strategy.py).
  - Enhanced error handling, logging, and user feedback throughout the CLI.

## What works

- **All Core Commands**: lookup, digest, extractfacts, brainstorm, strategy, draft, verify, counselnotes, barbrief, caseplan fully implemented and stable, now with robust large document handling and token counting.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions automated testing on all PRs for Python 3.11 and 3.12.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automated pytest runs with fast-fail on every commit.
- **Caseplan Enhancement**: Now generates executable bash scripts extracting all CLI commands from workflow plans.
- **Verification**: Now uses Claude 4 Opus, with broadened citation search and increased file size limits.
- **Prompt System**: YAML-based, updated for clarity, compliance, and new features.
- **Zero-Emoji Policy**: Enforced across codebase and documentation.
- **Testing**: Expanded and refactored test suite with pytest tmp_path fixtures and new unit tests.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive architectural docs, LaTeX article, and organized development planning docs.

## What’s left to build

- **[AG-124][P0] Implement circuit breaker for API retries**  
  - TODO.md: "Implement circuit breaker for API retries"

- **[EPIC-LLM][P1] Implement advanced LLM prompting improvements**  
  - IRAC/MIRAT, multi-model consensus, confidence scoring  
  - TODO.md: "Implement advanced LLM prompting improvements"

- **[QA][P1] Create OpenRouter validation tests**  
  - TODO.md: "Develop manual validation scripts for OpenRouter"

- **[UX][P1] Develop workflow commands**  
  - TODO.md: "Create compound workflow commands"

- **[MON][P2] Implement performance benchmarking and monitoring**  
  - TODO.md: "Automate performance benchmarking and monitoring setup"

- **[TECH][P2] Add --quality-tier flag and config**  
  - TODO.md: "Add cost-tracking system and quality-tier command options"

- **[DEBT][P2] Refactor verify_with_level**  
  - TODO.md: "Refactor verify_with_level (Option B)"

- **[MB][P2] Memory Bank Maintenance**  
  - Continue systematic updates after major changes

(AG- tags and priorities correspond to TODO.md and alignment plan.)

## Current status

**Feature Complete with Enhanced Infrastructure**: All core commands including counselnotes, barbrief, and enhanced caseplan are implemented and production-ready. Now on `feature/caseplan-fix` branch after adding CI/CD pipeline, pre-commit hooks, architectural documentation, and bash script generation for caseplan. Python requirement updated to >=3.11. Memory Bank, documentation, and codebase fully synchronized. Infrastructure improvements make the project more maintainable and professional. Ready for comprehensive testing before merge to master branch.

## Known issues

- [AG-124] Circuit breaker for API retries not yet implemented (see TODO.md)
- [EPIC-LLM] Advanced prompting and verification improvements remain unimplemented
- [QA] Integration testing for OpenRouter and Pinecone cleanup not yet automated
- [TECH] Cost-tracking and quality-tier features absent
- TODO.md contains additional feature items and technical debt tasks

## Evolution of project decisions

- Core pipeline implemented first, followed by citation verification enhancements and workflow clarifications.
- Configuration and logging centralized from CLI flags to config.yaml for consistency.
- Lookup command simplified to Jade.io only to avoid anti-bot issues; --comprehensive flag and extract options added.
- Clean CLI output, timestamped files, and professional summaries adopted as standard UX.
- Brainstorm vs strategy distinction clarified; integration pattern formalized.
- Two-phase citation verification and selective regeneration (“Option B”) established as quality control standard.
- Post-hoc verification (verify command) added to enable comprehensive quality checks on generated documents, including citation, legal soundness, and reasoning trace validation.
- Memory Bank practice formalized to preserve context and support onboarding after session resets.
- **Large document handling and token counting are now core to all major workflows.**
- **Prompt engineering and policy enforcement (e.g., zero-emoji) are critical for professional output and compliance.**
