# Progress

## Recent Developments (July 2025)

- **Large Document Handling & Token Counting**
  - Implemented chunk-based processing in `digest` and `strategy` commands (50k token chunks) to handle large legal documents and avoid API token limits.
  - Integrated `tiktoken` for accurate token counting in research file analysis and input size management.
  - Brainstorm command now analyzes research file size, warns users for >128k tokens, and displays file/token/word stats.
  - All commands updated to use improved error handling and user feedback for large input files.

- **Verification & Model Upgrades**
  - Switched verification system to Claude 4 Opus for higher accuracy and context window.
  - Broadened citation search scope and increased file size limits for extractfacts and lookup commands.
  - Two-phase citation verification and selective regeneration remain standard.

- **Prompt & Policy Refinements**
  - Major prompt YAML updates: barbrief.yaml, strategies.yaml, verification.yaml, caseplan.yaml, formats.yaml, glob_help_addon.yaml, lookup.yaml, system_feedback.yaml.
  - Enforced zero-emoji policy and standardized ASCII/ANSI output across all commands and documentation.
  - Improved code formatting and removed unused imports (e.g., verifying_message from strategy.py).
  - Enhanced error handling, logging, and user feedback throughout the CLI.

- **Documentation & Planning**
  - Added new technical and planning docs: `docs/prompts/LLM_PROMPT_EFFICIENCY_AND_PRECISION.md`, `docs/development/context_transition_plan.md`.
  - Updated INSTALLATION.md, README.md, TODO.md, CLAUDE.md, and user guides to reflect new features, policies, and workflows.
  - Memory Bank and .clinerules updated for new conventions and patterns.

- **Testing & Infrastructure**
  - Expanded and refactored test suite: new/updated unit tests, test scripts, and comprehensive coverage for new features.
  - Improved test output clarity and coverage for all major commands.

## What works

- **All Core Commands**: lookup, digest, extractfacts, brainstorm, strategy, draft, verify, counselnotes, barbrief fully implemented and stable, now with robust large document handling and token counting.
- **Verification**: Now uses Claude 4 Opus, with broadened citation search and increased file size limits.
- **Prompt System**: YAML-based, updated for clarity, compliance, and new features.
- **Zero-Emoji Policy**: Enforced across codebase and documentation.
- **Testing**: Expanded and refactored test suite for new features and improved output clarity.
- **Documentation**: Updated for all new features, policies, and workflows.

## What’s left to build

- **[AG-124][P0] Implement circuit breaker for API retries**  
  - TODO.md: "Implement circuit breaker for API retries"

- **[EPIC-LLM][P1] Implement advanced LLM prompting improvements**  
  - IRAC/MIRAT, multi-model consensus, confidence scoring  
  - TODO.md: "Implement advanced LLM prompting improvements"

- **[QA][P1] Create OpenRouter validation tests**  
  - TODO.md: "Develop manual validation scripts for OpenRouter"

- **[UX][P1] Develop workflow commands**  
  - TODO.md: "Create compound workflow commands"

- **[MON][P2] Implement performance benchmarking and monitoring**  
  - TODO.md: "Automate performance benchmarking and monitoring setup"

- **[TECH][P2] Add --quality-tier flag and config**  
  - TODO.md: "Add cost-tracking system and quality-tier command options"

- **[DEBT][P2] Refactor verify_with_level**  
  - TODO.md: "Refactor verify_with_level (Option B)"

- **[MB][P2] Memory Bank Maintenance**  
  - Continue systematic updates after major changes

(AG- tags and priorities correspond to TODO.md and alignment plan.)

## Current status

**Feature Complete**: All core commands including counselnotes and barbrief are implemented and production-ready. Now on `bugs/prerelease20250713` branch after completing large document handling, token counting, and verification upgrades. Memory Bank, documentation, and codebase fully synchronized. Barbrief completes the litigation document preparation pipeline, providing comprehensive brief generation for Australian barristers. Ready for merge to master branch.

## Known issues

- [AG-124] Circuit breaker for API retries not yet implemented (see TODO.md)
- [EPIC-LLM] Advanced prompting and verification improvements remain unimplemented
- [QA] Integration testing for OpenRouter and Pinecone cleanup not yet automated
- [TECH] Cost-tracking and quality-tier features absent
- TODO.md contains additional feature items and technical debt tasks

## Evolution of project decisions

- Core pipeline implemented first, followed by citation verification enhancements and workflow clarifications.
- Configuration and logging centralized from CLI flags to config.yaml for consistency.
- Lookup command simplified to Jade.io only to avoid anti-bot issues; --comprehensive flag and extract options added.
- Clean CLI output, timestamped files, and professional summaries adopted as standard UX.
- Brainstorm vs strategy distinction clarified; integration pattern formalized.
- Two-phase citation verification and selective regeneration (“Option B”) established as quality control standard.
- Post-hoc verification (verify command) added to enable comprehensive quality checks on generated documents, including citation, legal soundness, and reasoning trace validation.
- Memory Bank practice formalized to preserve context and support onboarding after session resets.
- **Large document handling and token counting are now core to all major workflows.**
- **Prompt engineering and policy enforcement (e.g., zero-emoji) are critical for professional output and compliance.**
