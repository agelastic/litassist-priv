# Progress

## What works
- All six core CLI commands (lookup, digest, extractfacts, brainstorm, strategy, draft) fully implemented and tested  
- Comprehensive citation verification (offline patterns + Jade.io online checks) integrated across workflows  
- Centralized configuration (config.yaml) and clean CLI output formats  
- Detailed documentation in README, INSTALLATION, docs/ and user guides  
- Logging and performance timing instrumentation (@timed, audit logs)  
- Robust test suite (unit tests, integration testing approach documented) and ruff linting passing  

## Whatâ€™s left to build
- Finalize Memory Bank by creating this file and committing the directory  
- Implement advanced features from LLM_IMPROVEMENTS.md (e.g., IRAC/MIRAT enforcement, multi-model consensus, confidence scoring)  
- Develop integration tests for OpenRouter and extended RAG workflows  
- Add cost-tracking, quality-tier system, and workflow compound commands  
- Enhance QA loops (adversarial testing, iterative improvement loops) and performance benchmarking  

## Current status
Memory Bank initialization underway; core project functionality complete and stable. Documentation and patterns formalized for ongoing development. Planning next feature phases based on documented improvements.

## Known issues
- Several advanced prompting and verification improvements remain unimplemented  
- Integration testing for OpenRouter and Pinecone cleanup not yet automated  
- Cost-tracking and quality-tier features absent  
- TODO.md contains additional feature items and technical debt tasks  

## Evolution of project decisions
- Core pipeline implemented first, followed by citation verification enhancements  
- Configuration centralized from CLI flags to config.yaml for consistency  
- Lookup command simplified to Jade.io only to avoid anti-bot issues  
- Memory Bank practice formalized to preserve context across sessions
