# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initialising the Memory Bank to document the LitAssist project’s core context, patterns, architecture, and technical setup following .clinerules guidelines.

## Recent Changes
- Created core Memory Bank files:
  - projectbrief.md  
  - productContext.md  
  - systemPatterns.md  
  - techContext.md  

## Next Steps
1. Create `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to complete Memory Bank initialization.  
2. Review Memory Bank for consistency and accuracy against project documentation.  
3. Commit Memory Bank files to repository.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Adhering strictly to Memory Bank hierarchy and .clinerules formatting rules.  
- Synthesizing documentation from existing READMEs, docs/, config.yaml.template, and CLI code.  
- Ensuring Memory Bank is self‑contained and provides the only source of prior session context.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- Use Markdown for all Memory Bank files.  
- Include mermaid diagrams where they aid clarity (already in projectbrief.md).  
- Reference code and docs accurately; avoid speculative content.

## Learnings & Insights
- The Memory Bank provides a reliable reference for project onboarding and context after session resets.  
- Centralizing architecture and technical context documents streamlines future development planning.
