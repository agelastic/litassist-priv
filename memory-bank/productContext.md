# Product Context

## Why this project exists

LitAssist addresses the manual, time‑intensive nature of litigation support by automating key workflows—research, document analysis, fact extraction, strategic planning, and drafting—using AI and a managed vector store. It aims to reduce the risk of citation errors and streamline the end‑to‑end process for legal practitioners.

## Problems it solves

- Manual case‑law research is slow and prone to omissions.  
- Large‑document summarization and issue‑spotting are error‑prone and inconsistent.  
- Extracting structured facts from unstructured documents is laborious.  
- Developing legal strategies requires deep domain expertise and auditing.  
- Drafting court‑ready documents is repetitive and time‑consuming.  
- Citation hallucinations by AI models pose professional liability risks.  

## How it should work

1. **Lookup**: Perform rapid, reliable case‑law searches with zero‑tolerance citation verification.  
2. **Digest**: Automatically generate summaries or issue‑spotting analyses for large documents.  
3. **ExtractFacts**: Produce a structured fact sheet with fixed headings to feed downstream workflows.  
4. **CounselNotes**: Generate strategic analysis from advocate's perspective with structured extractions.
5. **Barbrief**: Create comprehensive barrister's briefs with 10-section structure for litigation.
6. **Brainstorm**: Ideate orthodox and unorthodox strategies with transparent reasoning traces.  
7. **Strategy**: Convert selected strategies into tactical implementation plans with probability assessments.  
8. **Draft**: Create citation‑verified, professional‑grade legal documents using retrieval‑augmented generation.

## User Experience Goals

- **Global CLI**: Install once, use LitAssist from any directory.  
- **Clean Output**: Terminal shows concise summaries and next‑step commands.  
- **Timestamped Files**: Never overwrite outputs; create unique, audit‑ready files.  
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for every operation and LLM call.  
- **Zero‑Tolerance Citations**: Automatic validation and regeneration to eliminate fictitious references.  
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Separate reasoning traces for all strategic analyses.
