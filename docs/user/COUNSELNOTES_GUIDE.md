# Counsel's Notes Command Guide

The `counselnotes` command provides strategic analysis and tactical insights for legal documents from an advocate's perspective, complementing the neutral analysis provided by the `digest` command.

## Overview

Unlike the `digest` command which provides factual, neutral analysis, `counselnotes` offers:
- **Strategic perspective** from an advocate's viewpoint
- **Risk assessment** and tactical opportunities
- **Settlement considerations** and procedural advantages
- **Structured extraction** of citations, principles, and action items
- **Cross-document synthesis** for comprehensive case analysis

## Quick Start

### Basic Strategic Analysis
```bash
# Analyse a single document strategically
litassist counselnotes contract.pdf

# Analyse multiple documents with cross-synthesis
litassist counselnotes brief.pdf affidavit.pdf response.pdf

# Include citation verification
litassist counselnotes --verify case_bundle.pdf
```

### Structured Data Extraction
```bash
# Extract all structured elements as JSON
litassist counselnotes --extract all case_files.pdf

# Extract only citations
litassist counselnotes --extract citations pleadings.pdf

# Extract legal principles with authorities
litassist counselnotes --extract principles judgment.pdf

# Extract tactical checklist
litassist counselnotes --extract checklist case_docs.pdf
```

## Strategic Analysis Framework

The `counselnotes` command analyses documents using a structured framework:

### 1. Case Overview & Position
- Overall case strength assessment
- Client's strategic position
- Key factual advantages and disadvantages

### 2. Tactical Opportunities
- Procedural advantages to exploit
- Evidence strengths to emphasise
- Opposing party vulnerabilities
- Settlement leverage points

### 3. Risk Assessment
- Litigation risks and exposure
- Evidence gaps or weaknesses
- Potential adverse findings
- Cost-benefit considerations

### 4. Strategic Recommendations
- Recommended litigation approach
- Priority actions and next steps
- Resource allocation priorities
- Alternative dispute resolution considerations

### 5. Case Management Notes
- Key deadlines and milestones
- Witness considerations
- Expert evidence requirements
- Discovery/disclosure strategy

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Litigation Workflow
```bash
# 1. Initial document analysis (neutral)
litassist digest case_files.pdf

# 2. Strategic analysis (advocate perspective)
litassist counselnotes --extract all case_files.pdf

# 3. Generate strategic options
litassist strategy case_facts.txt

# 4. Draft legal documents
litassist draft case_facts.txt "statement of claim"
```

### Cross-Document Synthesis
When processing multiple documents, `counselnotes` automatically:
- Identifies common themes and issues across documents
- Synthesises strategic opportunities from combined evidence
- Highlights contradictions or gaps between documents
- Provides unified tactical recommendations

## Use Cases

### 1. Initial Case Assessment
```bash
# Analyse initial brief and supporting documents
litassist counselnotes --extract all brief.pdf exhibits.pdf
```
**Output**: Comprehensive strategic overview with risk assessment and recommendations.

### 2. Pre-Trial Preparation
```bash
# Extract tactical checklist for trial preparation
litassist counselnotes --extract checklist --verify witness_statements.pdf expert_reports.pdf
```
**Output**: Actionable checklist with citation verification for accuracy.

### 3. Settlement Preparation
```bash
# Strategic analysis for settlement negotiations
litassist counselnotes correspondence.pdf valuations.pdf
```
**Output**: Strategic analysis focused on settlement leverage and risks.

### 4. Appeal Preparation
```bash
# Extract legal principles for appeal grounds
litassist counselnotes --extract principles --verify judgment.pdf trial_transcripts.pdf
```
**Output**: Legal principles with authorities for appeal arguments.

## Best Practices

### Document Preparation
- **Ensure document quality**: Use clear, searchable PDFs or well-formatted text files
- **Include all relevant materials**: Combine related documents for better synthesis
- **Organise chronologically**: Present documents in logical sequence

### Strategic Analysis
- **Compare with digest output**: Use `counselnotes` alongside `digest` for complete perspective
- **Verify citations**: Always use `--verify` flag for documents citing legal authorities
- **Cross-reference recommendations**: Check strategic advice against available evidence

### Output Management
- **Use descriptive filenames**: Outputs are automatically timestamped for organization
- **Archive analysis**: Keep strategic analysis separate from factual digest
- **Track changes**: Re-run analysis as new documents become available

## Integration with Other Commands

### Complementary Commands
- **`digest`**: Provides neutral factual analysis to complement strategic perspective
- **`extractfacts`**: Generates structured case facts for further analysis
- **`strategy`**: Uses strategic insights to generate specific tactical options
- **`draft`**: Incorporates strategic analysis into document drafting
- **`verify`**: Validates citations and legal reasoning in outputs

### Workflow Examples

#### Complete Case Analysis
```bash

## Comparison: Counselnotes vs Digest

| Aspect | Digest (Neutral) | Counselnotes (Strategic) |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Perspective** | Objective, factual | Advocate, tactical |
| **Purpose** | Document understanding | Strategic planning |
| **Output Focus** | Chronology and issues | Opportunities and risks |
| **Best For** | Initial review | Case strategy development |
| **Client Use** | Background briefing | Strategic discussions |
| **Integration** | Facts → Strategy | Analysis → Tactics |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Large Document Processing
**Issue**: Documents too large for processing
**Solution**: 
- Break large documents into logical sections
- Use multiple `counselnotes` commands for different document sets
- Ensure documents are under file size limits

#### Citation Verification Failures
**Issue**: Citations marked as invalid during verification
**Solution**:
- Review document OCR quality
- Check citation format against Australian legal citation standards
- Use `--verify` flag selectively for documents with known good citations

#### Inconsistent Strategic Analysis
**Issue**: Strategic advice seems contradictory
**Solution**:
- Review input documents for completeness
- Ensure all relevant materials are included
- Compare with `digest` output for factual consistency

### Performance Considerations
- **Processing time**: Strategic analysis takes longer than basic digest
- **Token usage**: Complex analysis may consume more API tokens
- **Memory usage**: Multiple large documents require sufficient system memory
