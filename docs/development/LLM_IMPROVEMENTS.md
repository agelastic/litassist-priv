# LitAssist LLM Improvements Analysis

## Status Update (June 2025)

**Implemented:**
- Option B (selective regeneration/discard for citation issues in brainstorm/strategy)
- Multi-section reasoning traces (brainstorm)
- Strict two-phase citation verification (AustLII backend)
- Centralized config.yaml for all settings
- Model selection and BYOK requirements for advanced commands
- Clean CLI output, output timestamping, and professional summaries
- Comprehensive logging and timing for all operations

**Planned:**
- IRAC/MIRAT enforcement
- Multi-model consensus and iterative improvement loops
- Confidence scoring and advanced QA loops
- Cost-tracking and workflow compound commands

This document analyzes all LLM prompts, settings, and processing in LitAssist with recommendations for improvements that prioritize quality over cost.

## Executive Summary

LitAssist currently uses 6 different LLM integrations across its commands. While functional, there are significant opportunities to enhance legal reasoning, accuracy, and output quality by implementing more sophisticated prompting techniques, multi-stage refinement, and validation systems.

## Current LLM Architecture

### Models and Their Roles
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Case law research (fast, web-aware)
- **Claude 3 Sonnet**: Document processing (reliable extraction)
- **Grok 3 Beta**: Creative strategy generation (high creativity)
- **GPT-4o**: Strategic planning and drafting (balanced capabilities)

### Temperature Settings Philosophy
- **0.0**: Factual tasks (extraction, summaries)
- **0.2-0.5**: Analytical tasks (strategy, drafting)
- **0.9**: Creative tasks (brainstorming)

## Command-by-Command Analysis and Improvements

### 1. Lookup Command - Case Law Research

**Current State:**
- Model: `google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview`
- Temperature: 0 (IRAC) or 0.5 (broad)
- Basic prompt: Question + found links
- Simple citation guard retry

**Improvement Recommendations:**

```python
# Enhanced system prompt with legal expertise
system_prompt = """You are an expert Australian legal researcher with deep knowledge of:
- Case law hierarchy (HC > FCA/FCAFC > State Supreme > District > Magistrates)
- Statutory interpretation principles (Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth))
- Temporal relevance (prefer recent authorities unless foundational)
- Distinguishing ratio decidendi from obiter dicta

When analyzing cases:
1. Identify the legal principle established
2. Note any dissenting judgments
3. Check if subsequently overruled or distinguished
4. Extract relevant pinpoint paragraphs
5. Assess precedential value based on court hierarchy

Format citations as: Case Name [Year] Court Level Report (Judge Name at [para])
Example: Smith v Jones [2023] HCA 15; (2023) 412 ALR 1 (Gordon J at [45]-[47])"""

# Multi-pass refinement
refinement_passes = [
    "Initial research and analysis",
    "Review the above. What critical cases or statutes did I miss?",
    "Identify any conflicting authorities and reconcile them",
    "Provide practical application guidance for the practitioner"
]
```

**Benefits:**

2. Note page/paragraph reference
3. Assign confidence: 
   - HIGH (explicitly stated)
   - MEDIUM (reasonably inferred)
   - LOW (possible but uncertain)
4. Flag any contradictions between sources
5. Note corroboration across multiple sources

Example:
**Key Events**: 
- Contract signed on 1 March 2023 [HIGH confidence - page 3, para 2: "The parties executed the agreement on 1 March 2023"] [Corroborated: page 15, email confirmation]
- Breach occurred in April 2023 [MEDIUM confidence - page 8, para 5: "By April, deliveries had ceased"] [Contradiction: page 12 suggests May]

**Fact Verification Stage:**
After extraction, validate:
1. Internal consistency of timeline
2. Logical consistency of events
3. Missing critical facts marked "To be obtained"
4. Assumptions requiring validation
5. Gaps in evidence chain"""

# Add fact categorization

```

### 2. Multi-Model Consensus

For critical tasks (final drafts, strategy recommendations):

```python
def multi_model_consensus(prompt, task_type):
    """Get consensus from multiple models for critical tasks."""
    
    models = {
        "analytical": "openai/gpt-4o",

```

### 3. Iterative Improvement Loop

```python
def iterative_improvement(initial_output, task_type):
    """Iteratively improve output through targeted questioning."""
    
    improvement_rounds = [
        "What are the three weakest points in the above analysis?",

        Provide specific improvements addressing these issues.
        """
        current = generate_improvement(prompt)
        
    return current

### 4. Confidence Scoring System

```python
confidence_scoring = """
For each conclusion or recommendation, provide:

**Confidence Score** (0-100%):
- 90-100%: Settled law, clear facts, strong precedent
- 70-89%: Good authority, reasonable inference
- 50-69%: Arguable position, some uncertainty
- 30-49%: Novel argument, significant risks
- 0-29%: Speculative, against weight of authority

**Factors affecting confidence:**
- Quality of authorities cited
- Directness of factual support
- Consistency with established principle
- Jurisdictional variations
- Temporal relevance

**Uncertainty sources:**
- Missing facts (list specifically)
- Unsettled law (cite conflicting authorities)
- Discretionary factors
- Procedural variables
"""
```

### 5. Australian Legal Context Enhancement

```python
australian_legal_context = """
Always consider Australian-specific factors:

1. **Uniform legislation variations** between states
2. **Federal/State jurisdictional complexity**
3. **Costs jurisdiction** and scale of costs
4. **Implied undertaking** in discovery
5. **Calderbank offers** and costs consequences
6. **Model litigant obligations** for government
7. **Proportionality** in civil procedure
8. **Overriding purpose** of just, quick, cheap resolution

Reference relevant practice directions and court guides.
