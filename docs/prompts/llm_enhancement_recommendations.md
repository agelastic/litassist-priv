## 4. Recommendations for Enhancement

The following recommendations aim to build upon the existing strong foundation of `litassist/llm.py`. Many of these may align with ideas potentially discussed in `docs/development/LLM_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

**A. Enhancing Precision:**

1.  **Refine `reasoning_effort` for `o3-pro`**:
    *   **Action**: Systematically test and document the impact of different `reasoning_effort` values for `openai/o3-pro` in commands like `strategy` and `draft`.
    *   **Rationale**: Since temperature/top_p are fixed for `o3-pro`, `reasoning_effort` is a key lever for output quality and precision. Understanding its effect can optimize these commands. (Aligned with general LLM optimization principles).
2.  **Introduce a "Max-Precision" Profile for Sensitive Tasks**:
    *   **Action**: For commands like `extractfacts`, consider adding an optional profile that uses a model like `anthropic/claude-opus-4` (currently in `verify`) with temperature 0, if not already the case, or explore models specifically fine-tuned for information extraction.
    *   **Rationale**: Provides an even higher tier of precision for the most critical information extraction tasks where cost is secondary to accuracy.

**B. Boosting Creativity:**

1.  **Dynamic Temperature/Top_p Adjustment**:
    *   **Action**: For brainstorming commands, explore allowing users (or an intermediary logic) to suggest a "creativity level" that dynamically adjusts temperature and top_p within reasonable bounds.
    *   **Rationale**: Offers more fine-grained control over creative output beyond the orthodox/unorthodox split. (Aligned with providing users more control over LLM behavior).
2.  **Expand Model Palette for Brainstorming**:
    *   **Action**: Periodically evaluate and integrate new models known for strong creative or divergent thinking capabilities into `brainstorm-unorthodox` or new sub-commands.
    *   **Rationale**: Leverages the rapidly evolving LLM landscape to continuously improve creative output quality and diversity.

**C. Maximizing Legal Accuracy:**

1.  **Tiered Verification Prompts in `verify_with_level`**:
    *   **Action**: Further differentiate the prompts used in `verify_with_level` for "light", "medium", and "heavy". For "heavy", the prompt could instruct the LLM to specifically check for logical fallacies in legal arguments, outdated legal principles, or jurisdictional relevance, beyond general accuracy and Australian English.
    *   **Rationale**: Provides more targeted verification. "Heavy" verification could become a more powerful analytical tool. (This refines the existing `verify_with_level` structure).
2.  **Feedback Loop for Citation Verification**:
    *   **Action**: Implement a mechanism to log and review frequently failing or problematic citations. This data could be used to refine citation parsing logic or identify gaps in the verification database.
    *   **Rationale**: Improves the long-term reliability of the citation verification system.
3.  **Enhanced `force_verify` Strictness**:
    *   **Action**: For commands with `force_verify = True`, ensure that if citation retry fails, the operation either halts with a clear error or the problematic section is explicitly marked/removed with user notification, rather than just silently removing citations in lenient mode (current behavior suggests strict mode failure leads to retry, then potential error).
    *   **Rationale**: Increases the guarantee that outputs from `force_verify` commands are either fully compliant or clearly flag issues.

**D. General Recommendations:**

1.  **Configuration for `CONFIG.use_token_limits`**:
    *   **Action**: Ensure that the `CONFIG.use_token_limits` flag and the specific token limit values are easily configurable, perhaps outside of the core code, to adapt to different operational environments or new model versions.
    *   **Rationale**: Improves maintainability and adaptability of the system.
2.  **Regular Model Evaluation**:
    *   **Action**: Establish a process for regularly evaluating the performance of all used models (especially for accuracy, cost, and speed) and updating the `COMMAND_CONFIGS` as newer, better, or more cost-effective models become available via OpenRouter or direct integrations.
    *   **Rationale**: Keeps LitAssist at the forefront of LLM technology and efficiency. (Standard MLOps practice).
3.  **Parameterization of `reasoning_effort`**:
    *   **Action**: If `reasoning_effort` proves highly beneficial for `o3-pro`, consider adding it as an explicit, albeit optional, parameter in the `COMMAND_CONFIGS` for `o3-pro` based commands, rather than only as a potential override.
    *   **Rationale**: Makes this important control more visible and consistently manageable.
