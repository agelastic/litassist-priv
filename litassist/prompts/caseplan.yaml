      2. PHASED WORKFLOW - EVIDENCE-DRIVEN SYNTHESIS FOCUS
         
         WORKFLOW PHILOSOPHY:
         - Phases 1-5: Evidence Gathering & Document Analysis (40% of effort)
           * Focus on documentary evidence from case_facts.txt
           * Create specific placeholder filenames for expected documents
         - Phases 6-10: Legal Research & Opposition Testing (40% of effort)
           * Research our legal positions for strength
           * Research opposing arguments for weaknesses
         - Phases 11-15: Strategic Synthesis & Goal-Specific Memoranda (20% of effort)
           * Synthesize evidence + research into actionable intelligence
           * Draft documents targeting specific monetary/legal outcomes
         
         The goal is to build from available evidence, test all legal positions,
         systematically counter opposing arguments, and produce goal-specific deliverables.
         
         For each phase include:
         - Phase number and descriptive name (specific to case issues)
         - Purpose and value delivered (mention specific evidence/claims)
         
         ### COMMAND:
         ```bash
         litassist [exact command with case-specific parameters]
         ```
         
         - Information flow (what specific evidence/research feeds in)
         - Cost estimate for phase
         - Time estimate
         - ESSENTIAL or OPTIONAL tag
         - Dependencies on prior phases
         - Output utilization (how output feeds forward)
         - Evidence focus or Opposition addressed

      2A. CASE FACTS DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
         - Initial case_facts.txt is typically a preliminary skeleton requiring enhancement
         - Early workflow phases must focus on strengthening case_facts.txt before downstream use
         - digest and extractfacts operations discover additional facts requiring case_facts.txt updates
         - Plan explicit case_facts.txt enhancement phases after fact-gathering operations
         - Stronger case_facts.txt foundation leads to better brainstorm/strategy/draft outcomes

      2B. CRITICAL ERRORS TO AVOID
         [WRONG] litassist extractfacts case_facts.txt
         [CORRECT] litassist extractfacts source_documents.pdf

         [WRONG] litassist brainstorm source_documents.pdf
         [CORRECT] litassist brainstorm case_facts.txt

         - extractfacts ONLY processes source documents (.pdf, .txt, .docx)
         - case_facts.txt is OUTPUT of extractfacts, never INPUT
         - If you generate "extractfacts case_facts.txt" - THIS IS ALWAYS WRONG

      2B-1. WORKFLOW SEQUENCING LOGIC
         - extractfacts is used on source documents (not on case_facts.txt) to create or enhance case_facts.txt
         - digest is used on documents to discover facts, which are then manually added to case_facts.txt
         - brainstorm, strategy, draft, and barbrief all require a structured case_facts.txt as input
         - Never run extractfacts on case_facts.txt itself
         - Typical sequence:
           1. extractfacts bank_statements.pdf vehicle_docs.pdf -> Creates/updates case_facts.txt
           2. digest source_documents.pdf -> Summaries/facts for manual case_facts.txt update
           3. brainstorm case_facts.txt -> Creates strategies
           4. strategy case_facts.txt -> Tactical plans
           5. draft case_facts.txt strategies.txt -> Legal documents

      2B-2. WORKFLOW VALIDATION
         - If any phase generates "extractfacts case_facts.txt" or similar, THIS IS ALWAYS WRONG and must be corrected to use source documents as input.
         - Phase 1 should always be: Extract Facts from Source Documents
           Example: litassist extractfacts bank_statements.pdf vehicle_docs.pdf
         - case_facts.txt is only ever the OUTPUT of extractfacts, and the INPUT to brainstorm/strategy/draft/barbrief.

         Key Deliverables: Feasibility memorandum, Strategic recommendation, 15+ research reports

      2E. EVIDENCE-BASED COMMAND GENERATION RULES
         
         CRITICAL: Every command must be tailored to the specific case facts, not generic templates.
         
         DOCUMENT PLACEHOLDER REQUIREMENTS:
         - Create descriptive filenames that indicate document content and relevance
         - Examples of GOOD placeholders:
           * bank_statements_joint_account_2023-2024.pdf
           * employment_contract_respondent_tech_company.pdf
           * text_messages_custody_discussions_jan2025.pdf
           * medical_report_child_autism_diagnosis.pdf
         - Examples of BAD placeholders:
           * documents.pdf
           * evidence.pdf
           * financial_records.pdf
         - Include dates, parties, or specific issues in filenames
         
         CASE-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS:
         - Extract actual details from case_facts.txt for all parameters:
           * --hint: Must reference specific evidence, dates, parties from the case
           * --focus: Must mention actual legal issues and party names
           * --instructions: Must cite specific claims and amounts
         - Examples based on case content:
           * GOOD: --hint "analyze the $40,364 vehicle purchase by Vitaly Osipov on 3 June 2023"
           * BAD: --hint "focus on vehicle ownership"
           * GOOD: --instructions "Focus on Marcus Wong's claim of gift despite registration in Osipov name"
           * BAD: --instructions "Focus on ownership dispute"
         
         RESEARCH QUERY CONSTRUCTION:
         - Base queries on three sources from case_facts.txt:
           1. EVIDENCE AVAILABLE: What documents/proof do we have?
           2. LEGAL ISSUES: What are our arguments that need support?
           3. OPPOSING ARGUMENTS: What claims must we counter?
         - Structure queries to:
           * Verify strength of our legal position
           * Find weaknesses in opponent's arguments
           * Discover precedents for similar evidence patterns
         - Examples:
           * "de facto relationship property rights when gift presumption meets advancement doctrine and vehicle registration in sole name"
           * "incomplete gift of motor vehicle when keys delivered but donor retains control"
           * "detinue and conversion damages calculation using market value and depreciation"
         
         OPPOSING ARGUMENT ANALYSIS WORKFLOW:
         - Dedicate specific phases to systematically address each opposing claim
         - For each opposing argument identified in case_facts.txt:
           1. Research query to find contrary authority
           2. Document analysis to find contradictory evidence
           3. Strategy development to counter the argument
         - Example phases:
           * Phase 5: Counter "Gift Claim" - Research incomplete gift elements
           * Phase 6: Analyze financial records contradicting gift intent
           * Phase 7: Develop strategy to prove retained control over vehicle
         - Use --hint parameters that specifically target opposing claims:
           * --hint "identify evidence contradicting Marcus Wong's gift claim from June 2023"
           * --hint "analyze retained control indicators despite key handover"
         
         FINAL DOCUMENT SPECIFICITY:
         - Draft commands must target specific case objectives with amounts/parties:
           * GOOD: "Draft memorandum analyzing feasibility of recovering $40,364 from Marcus Wong"
           * BAD: "Draft feasibility memorandum"
           * GOOD: "Draft originating application for declaration Vitaly Osipov owns 2023 BMW"
           * BAD: "Draft originating application"
         
         COMMAND FORMATTING FOR PROMINENCE:
         - ALWAYS format commands as:
         
         ### COMMAND:
         ```bash
         litassist [command] [specific args based on case]
         ```
         
         - Add blank line before and after command blocks
         - Use bash syntax highlighting in markdown
         - Group related commands under clear phase headers
      
      2F. SWITCH EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS
         - After each command, provide a one-liner explaining technical switch choices
         - Focus on non-obvious switches: --mode, --comprehensive, --extract, --diversity, --verify
         - Format: # Switch rationale: [brief explanation of switch choices]
         - Examples:
           * # Switch rationale: --comprehensive for novel legal intersection, --mode irac for structured court analysis
           * # Switch rationale: --mode broad for cost strategy exploration, --extract citations for settlement letter
           * # Switch rationale: No --comprehensive (established tort), --extract citations for brief preparation
           * # Switch rationale: --diversity 0.8 for comprehensive memorandum coverage
         - Do NOT explain obvious switches like --side, --area, --facts, --budget, filenames
         - Keep explanations under 15 words focusing on WHY not WHAT

      3. ADAPTIVE STRUCTURE
         - Simple cases: 4-6 essential phases
         - Medium cases: 7-10 phases  
         - Complex cases: 10-15 phases
         - Budget constraints respected

      3A. INFORMATION SYNTHESIS METHODOLOGY
         
         SYNTHESIS PHILOSOPHY:
         Information synthesis through counselnotes is the KEY to transforming raw data into strategic intelligence.
         Think of litigation as an information pyramid:
         - Base: Raw documents, evidence, case law (Phases 1-5)
         - Middle: Analyzed and organized information (Phases 6-10)  
         - Peak: Strategic memoranda and recommendations (Phases 11-15)
         
         SYNTHESIS PATTERNS:
         1. Vertical Synthesis: Combine same-type information (all research, all strategies)
         2. Horizontal Synthesis: Combine different types (research + strategies + evidence)
         3. Iterative Synthesis: Multiple counselnotes passes with different combinations
         4. Final Synthesis: Everything combined for comprehensive memoranda
         
         COUNSELNOTES AS SYNTHESIS ENGINE:
         - First Pass: Combine all lookup research -> Legal framework document
         - Second Pass: Combine all strategies -> Strategic options assessment
         - Third Pass: Combine research + strategies -> Integrated analysis
         - Fourth Pass: Add evidence digests -> Complete factual and legal picture
         - Final Pass: Everything combined -> Feasibility memorandum foundation
         
         MEMORANDA FOCUS:
         The entire workflow builds toward two key deliverables:
         1. Comprehensive Feasibility Memorandum (10-20 pages)
            - All legal theories analyzed with authorities
            - Risk assessments for each approach
            - Cost-benefit analysis
            - Timeline projections
            - Recommended approach with rationale
         
         2. Executive Strategic Recommendation (2-3 pages)
            - Clear recommended path forward
            - Key risks and mitigation strategies
            - Implementation timeline
            - Success metrics
         
      3B. ENHANCED WORKFLOW SEQUENCING
         
         PHASE GROUP 1 - FOUNDATION BUILDING (Days 1-3):
         Essential Phases:
         - Extract facts from all source documents
         - Digest documents for hidden facts and context

      4. COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION GATHERING PRINCIPLES
         
         RESEARCH DEPTH:
         - Minimal budget: 5-8 lookup queries covering core issues
         - Standard budget: 10-15 queries for comprehensive coverage
         - Comprehensive budget: 15-25 queries leaving no stone unturned
         
         STRATEGIC GENERATION:
         - Always run initial brainstorm WITHOUT research (creative freedom)
         - Always run second brainstorm WITH research (precedent-backed)
         - Consider defendant perspective brainstorm for settlement leverage
         
         SYNTHESIS REQUIREMENTS:
         - Counselnotes after EVERY major information gathering phase
         - Multiple synthesis passes with different document combinations
         - Final synthesis must include ALL generated materials
         
         DOCUMENT SELECTION:
         - Include ALL relevant documents in digest phases
         - Process documents in logical groups (financial, correspondence, legal)
         - Re-run extractfacts whenever significant new facts discovered
         
         MEMORANDA STANDARDS:
         - Feasibility memorandum must analyze minimum 3 approaches
         - Each approach requires legal authority, risk assessment, timeline
         - Executive summary must fit on 2-3 pages maximum
         - All memoranda must pass verification before delivery

      5. PRACTICAL GUIDANCE
         - Clear next steps
         - Common pitfalls
         - Decision points
         - Cost-saving alternatives

         - Show all phases as nodes, with arrows for dependencies.
         - Represent decision points (branching) as diamonds.
         - Distinguish ESSENTIAL vs OPTIONAL phases (e.g., color/style).
         - Annotate phases with cost/time where helpful.
         - Place the diagram after the phased workflow section.
         - Keep all text-based dependency/decision comments as before.

      7. DELIVERABLE ALLOCATION
         For each phase, specify target recipients:

         SOLICITOR DELIVERABLES:
         - Case facts summaries (extractfacts output)

    budget_assessment_system: |
      You are an experienced litigation strategist conducting a sophisticated case assessment.
      Your task is to evaluate case complexity across multiple dimensions and recommend an appropriate budget level.
      
      Consider that litigation success often depends on information superiority - having more thorough research,
      better synthesis, and clearer strategic thinking than the opponent. Budget recommendations should reflect
      the information intensity required for success.

    budget_assessment_instructions: |
      Based on the case facts below, provide a structured assessment:
      
      1. COMPLEXITY SCORING (Rate each 1-10):
         - Legal Complexity: [Novel issues, multiple causes of action, statutory interpretation]
         - Factual Complexity: [Volume of evidence, disputed timeline, witness credibility]
         - Procedural Complexity: [Jurisdiction, limitation periods, interlocutory applications]
         - Strategic Complexity: [Opponent resources, public interest, precedent value]
         - Documentary Complexity: [Volume of documents, technical content, foreign language]
         
      2. CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:
         - What are the 3-5 factors that will determine case outcome?
         - What information/research is essential vs optional?
         - What are the highest-risk elements requiring extensive analysis?

         - Timeline: 15-20 days
         - Cost: $100-150
         
      4. JUSTIFICATION:
         - Why this budget level matches case requirements
         - What would be missed with a lower budget
         - Risk of under-resourcing vs over-resourcing
         - Expected ROI for recommended approach
         
      5. ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:
         - If budget constraints exist, what's the minimum viable approach?
         - What phases could be deferred or made optional?
         - What are the risks of the reduced approach?
