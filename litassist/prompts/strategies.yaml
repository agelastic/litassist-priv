      Analyze ALL the strategies above and select EXACTLY 5 of the most promising strategies for a detailed review.

      **SELECTION CRITERIA:**
      - Legal merit and strength of precedent
      - Practical feasibility and resource requirements
      - Alignment with client objectives and risk/reward ratio
      - Strength of available evidence

      **REQUIRED ANALYSIS:**
      For each of the 5 selected strategies, provide a detailed analysis covering:
      1. **Why this strategy was selected** (detailed reasoning against the criteria)
      2. **Implementation roadmap** (3-5 key sequential steps)
      3. **Risk assessment** (potential downsides and mitigation)
      4. **Success probability** (a percentage with qualitative justification)

      **IMPORTANT:** After the analysis of the 5 strategies, you MUST conclude with a section titled "## MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED". Under this exact heading, list the top 1-3 strategies from your analysis that you most strongly recommend. This section is critical for downstream processing.
