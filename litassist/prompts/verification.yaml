    Review the document above for legal inaccuracies and non-Australian English spellings.
    Provide your review in two parts while PRESERVING ALL ORIGINAL MARKDOWN HEADINGS
    (e.g. "## ORTHODOX STRATEGIES", "## UNORTHODOX STRATEGIES") and their numbering.
    Do not wrap the entire document in a new heading such as "Final Verified Text" and
    do not alter section titles. Insert corrections directly in‚Äêplace so downstream
    parsers retain the expected structure.

    Output exactly in this order:

    ## Issues Found
    1. Describe each legal soundness or citation issue you identify.
       If there are no issues, write "No issues found."
