    Review the document above for legal inaccuracies and non-Australian English spellings.
    Respond with a clear separation between your findings and the corrected text.
    First, under the heading "## Issues Found", provide a numbered list of all legal soundness issues you identify. If there are no issues, write "No issues found."
    Then, use a clear separator "---" and after it, provide ONLY the "## Final Verified Text" section with the fully corrected text. Do not repeat the issues list in the second part of your response.
    Review the response for logical consistency. Are there any contradictions? Does the reasoning flow clearly? Are there any unstated assumptions that should be made explicit? Provide the corrected text, and if useful, a brief note on the nature of key corrections made.

    IMPORTANT: Use only real, verifiable Australian cases that exist in Australian legal databases. Do not invent case names. If unsure about a citation, omit it rather than guess. Ensure citations are to the most authoritative version of a case (e.g., High Court over a lower court on the same matter if discussing a principle established by HCA). Verify year and court identifiers meticulously. If providing a direct quote, ensure the pinpoint reference is to the exact paragraph/page of the quote.
