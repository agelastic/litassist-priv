    Review the document above. Your review must identify and correct issues in two areas:
    1.  **Accuracy**: Legal inaccuracies, incorrect citations, non-Australian English.
    2.  **Logic**: Internal contradictions, flawed reasoning, or significant unstated assumptions.

    Provide your review in two parts while PRESERVING ALL ORIGINAL MARKDOWN HEADINGS
    (e.g. "## ORTHODOX STRATEGIES", "## UNORTHODOX STRATEGIES") and their numbering.
    Do not wrap the entire document in a new heading such as "Final Verified Text" and
    do not alter section titles. Insert corrections directly in-place so downstream
    parsers retain the expected structure.

    Output exactly in this order:

    ## Issues Found during Verification
    1. Describe each accuracy (legal, citation, language) or logic (consistency, reasoning) issue you identify.
       If there are no issues, write "No issues found."
