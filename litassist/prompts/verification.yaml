    CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST return the COMPLETE document with ALL original text.
    DO NOT use ANY placeholders, summaries, or abbreviations like:
    - "[Section reproduced in full...]"
    - "[unchanged during verification]"
    - "[no substantive changes]"
    - "..." or any ellipsis

    MANDATORY: Copy every single word from the original document exactly as written.
    If a section needs no changes, copy it word-for-word in its entirety.

    Example: If you see "## MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED" followed by 5 paragraphs,
    you MUST include all 5 paragraphs in full, not a placeholder.

    Review the document above. Your review must identify and correct issues in two areas:
    1.  **Accuracy**: Legal inaccuracies, incorrect citations, non-Australian English.
    2.  **Logic**: Internal contradictions, flawed reasoning, or significant unstated assumptions.

    Provide your review in two parts while PRESERVING ALL ORIGINAL CONTENT STRUCTURE including:
    - ALL markdown headings at any level (##, ###, etc.)
    - Special markers like "=== REASONING ==="
    - Section numbering and formatting
    - The COMPLETE document with ALL sections

    Examples of headers to preserve: "## ORTHODOX STRATEGIES", "## UNORTHODOX STRATEGIES", 
    "## MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED", "### Executive Summary", etc.

    Do not omit any sections. Return the ENTIRE document with corrections made inline.

    Output exactly in this order:

    ## Issues Found during Verification
    1. Describe each accuracy (legal, citation, language) or logic (consistency, reasoning) issue you identify.
       If there are no issues, write "No issues found."

    ---
    ## Verified and Corrected Document
    START DIRECTLY with the actual document content (e.g., "## ORTHODOX STRATEGIES" or the document title).
    NEVER include system instructions like "Australian law only" at the beginning.
    
    Return the COMPLETE full text with corrections made inline. All unchanged lines MUST be
    reproduced verbatim exactly as they appear. Never use placeholders like "[unchanged]" or 
    abbreviations. 
    
    For EVERY numbered strategy (1-10 in Orthodox/Unorthodox sections), add a comment at the end:
    - If you made corrections: "(corrected: [brief description of changes])"
    - If no corrections needed: "(unchanged during verification)"
    
    IMPORTANT: For analysis sections (like "MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED" or "ANALYSIS OF SELECTED STRATEGIES"):
    - Reproduce the FULL content without any abbreviation
    - NEVER use "..." or placeholders to shorten content
    - Add only ONE comment at the very end of the entire section
    - Preserve ALL strategy analysis text exactly as written
    
    Examples:
    - "(corrected: updated Bosanac citation to [2022] HCA 34)"
    - "(corrected: changed 'license' to 'licence' throughout)"
    - "(unchanged during verification)"
    
    The document MUST start with its actual content, not with any meta-instructions.
