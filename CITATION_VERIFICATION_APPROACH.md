# Citation Verification Implementation for LitAssist

## Problem Statement

AI models are notoriously unreliable when it comes to legal precedent, often hallucinating case names, citations, or misrepresenting the holdings of real cases. This poses a critical reliability issue for legal AI tools.

## **IMPLEMENTED SOLUTION**

**Status: âœ… COMPLETED** - Comprehensive citation verification system implemented with zero tolerance for fictitious citations.

## Core Implementation Architecture

### 1. Real-Time AustLII Verification (`litassist/citation_verify.py`)

**âœ… IMPLEMENTED**: Complete verification module with the following capabilities:

#### Citation Extraction & Parsing
```python
def extract_citations(text: str) -> List[str]
def normalize_citation(citation: str) -> str
def build_austlii_url(citation: str) -> Tuple[str, str]
```
- Extracts medium-neutral citations `[YEAR] COURT NUMBER`
- Extracts traditional citations `(YEAR) VOLUME COURT PAGE`
- Handles 40+ Australian court abbreviations
- Builds direct AustLII URLs for verification

#### Real-Time Verification Engine
```python
def verify_single_citation(citation: str) -> Tuple[bool, str, str]
def verify_all_citations(text: str) -> Tuple[List[str], List[Tuple[str, str]]]
def check_url_exists(url: str, timeout: int = 5) -> bool
```
- Makes HEAD requests to AustLII to verify case existence
- Caches results with threading locks for performance
- Returns detailed verification status and failure reasons
- Handles timeouts and network errors gracefully

#### Comprehensive Court Coverage
Supports all major Australian courts with establishment date validation:
- **High Court**: HCA (1903+)
- **Federal Courts**: FCA, FCAFC, FamCA, FamCAFC (1970s+)
- **State Supreme Courts**: NSWSC, VSC, QSC, SASC, WASC, TASSC, ACTSC, NTSC
- **State Appeal Courts**: NSWCA, VSCA, QCA, WASCA, etc.
- **Specialist Courts**: FCWA, VCAT, QCAT, SACAT, etc.

### 2. Strict Verification Integration (`litassist/llm.py`)

**âœ… IMPLEMENTED**: Zero-tolerance enforcement built into LLMClient:

#### Automatic Verification in LLM Complete
```python
def validate_and_verify_citations(self, content: str, strict_mode: bool = True) -> Tuple[str, List[str]]
```
- **Every LLM output** is automatically verified
- **Strict mode always enabled** - no command flags needed
- **Blocks output** if unverified citations detected
- **Automatic retry** with enhanced prompts on failure

#### Smart Retry Logic
```python
# First attempt fails â†’ Enhanced prompt retry
enhanced_messages[-1]["content"] += (
    "\n\nIMPORTANT: Use only real, verifiable Australian cases that exist on AustLII. "
    "Do not invent case names. If unsure about a citation, omit it rather than guess."
)
```
- Automatic retry when citations fail verification
- Enhanced prompts instruct AI to avoid hallucination
- Cascading failure protection with clear error messages

#### Surgical Citation Removal
```python
def remove_citation_from_text(text: str, citation: str) -> str
def is_core_citation(text_section: str, citation: str) -> bool
```
- Intelligently removes bad citations while preserving text flow
- Distinguishes between core and supporting citations
- Maintains readability after citation removal

### 3. Enhanced Pattern Detection

**âœ… IMPLEMENTED**: Sophisticated heuristics for common hallucination patterns:

#### Generic Name Detection
- Flags common surnames: Smith, Jones, Brown, Wilson, etc.
- Detects placeholder patterns: Test v Example, A v B, Doe v Roe
- Identifies suspiciously short names and single letters

#### Court Validation
- Validates court abbreviations against known Australian courts
- Checks establishment dates (e.g., FCA didn't exist before 1977)
- Flags impossible citation numbers (e.g., HCA exceeding 100 per year)
- Detects future years and anachronistic references

#### Report Series Validation
- Validates CLR, ALR, FCR, FLR, NSWLR, VR, QR, SASR, WAR
- Checks publication years against series establishment dates
- Flags impossible volume/page combinations

### 4. Command Integration

**âœ… IMPLEMENTED**: All commands updated with automatic verification:

#### lookup Command
```python
# Note: Citation verification now handled automatically in LLMClient.complete()
```
- Automatic verification of search results
- No manual validation needed
- Clean output with verified citations only

#### brainstorm Command
```python
orthodox_client = LLMClient("x-ai/grok-3-beta", temperature=0.3, top_p=0.7)
# Grok outputs automatically verified due to hallucination tendency
```
- Automatic verification for all 20+ generated strategies
- Special handling for Grok model (auto-verification enabled)
- Clean strategy output with verified citations only

#### strategy Command
```python
# strategy always needs verification as it creates foundational strategic documents
verify = True  # Force verification for critical accuracy
```
- Mandatory verification for strategic legal guidance
- Heavy verification level for high-stakes content
- Blocks unverified citations in strategic options

#### draft Command
```python
client.command_context = "draft"  # Set command context
# Smart verification with conditional depth
needs_verification = verify or client.should_auto_verify(content, "draft")
```
- Automatic verification triggered by citations/statutory references
- Heavy verification for legal drafting
- Clean drafts with verified citations only

#### extractfacts Command
```python
verify = True  # Force verification for critical accuracy
# Mandatory heavy verification for extractfacts (creates foundational documents)
```
- Always verified (creates foundational documents)
- Heavy verification for legal accuracy
- Ensures clean fact extraction

### 5. Performance Optimization

**âœ… IMPLEMENTED**: Efficient caching and threading:

#### Citation Cache
```python
_citation_cache: Dict[str, Dict] = {}
_cache_lock = threading.Lock()
```
- Thread-safe local caching of verification results
- Avoids repeated API calls for same citations
- Includes timestamps for cache freshness

#### Statistics and Monitoring
```python
def get_verification_stats() -> Dict
def clear_verification_cache()
```
- Tracks verification hit rates and success rates
- Provides debugging and performance metrics
- Cache management utilities

## User Experience

### Automatic Operation
- **No manual flags required** - verification always strict
- **No user intervention needed** - automatic retry on failures
- **Clean output guaranteed** - no fictitious citations pass through

### Error Handling
```
ðŸš« CRITICAL: Unverified citations detected:
- Smith v Jones [2023] HCA 99: Not found on AustLII
- Brown v Green [2022] NSWSC 1234: Not found on AustLII

ðŸ”„ Retrying with enhanced citation instructions...
âœ… Retry successful: All citations verified
```

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal delay**: 1-3 seconds for verification
- **Cached results**: Instant for previously verified citations
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple citations verified simultaneously

### Error Handling Strategy
1. **Citation extraction** from LLM output
2. **Real-time verification** against AustLII

4. **Critical error** if multiple attempts fail
5. **Clean output** with only verified citations

### Verification Levels
- **Pattern validation**: Immediate detection of obvious fakes
- **URL verification**: Real-time AustLII existence checking
- **Smart retry**: Enhanced prompts for second attempts
- **Complete blocking**: No output with unverified citations

## Success Metrics (Achieved)
